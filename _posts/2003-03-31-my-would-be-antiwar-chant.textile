h1. {{ page.title }}

If I were a "filthy antiwar protester":http://www.thesimon.com/article_of_week/266/ (ha!), I think my chant would go something like this:

Hey Big Brother, war ain't peace,
and two plus two ain't five!
Baghdad isn't up for lease
and bombing Iraqis is jive!

The protest movement totally sweats me.
