title: "An Unfinished Idea: Scala Quick Reference"
---

h1. {{ page.title }}

Every programming language should have something akin to the <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/Languages/Ruby/QuickRef.html">Ruby QuickRef</a> or <a href="http://rgruet.free.fr/PQR25/PQR2.5.html">Python Quick Reference</a>. These dense but easy navigated guides provide easily forgotten information about the most frequently used features of a language.

"How do I do a regex again? Ah, that's right." That's what a quick reference provides.

I intend on starting a Scala QuickRef and hosting it (both the "source" and the user-facing site itself) on GitHub for collaboration.
