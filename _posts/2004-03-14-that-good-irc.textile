"Colloquy":http://www.javelin.cc/colloquy/index.html is such an unfathomably good IRC client it's ... unfathomable.  I cannot fathom it.  Presently not fathoming.  So forth.
It's for OS X and acts like it all proper.  It makes IRC pretty so you can ignore the inane conversations.  It is good and free and open and righteous.
