h1. {{ page.title }}

This has been a Big Year for me. In 2010 I:

# Got married.
# Moved from "San Francisco":http://al3x.net/2009/10/04/so-youre-moving-to-san-francisco.html to Portland, Oregon.
# Quit my job at Twitter.
# "Joined BankSimple":http://al3x.net/2010/05/17/something-new.html.
# Helped BankSimple "raise our $2.9M Series A funding":http://banksimple.com/blog/2010/09/01/funding-next-steps/.
# Organized the first "Emerging Languages Camp":http://al3x.net/2010/04/05/elc.html, which was successful enough that it's going to become a regular part of OSCON.
# "Bought a house":http://al3x.net/2010/10/07/house.html in Portland's West Hills and moved into it.

In 2011 I will:

# Ship "BankSimple":https://www.banksimple.com/.

That's it. Anything else I accomplish next year is gravy.
