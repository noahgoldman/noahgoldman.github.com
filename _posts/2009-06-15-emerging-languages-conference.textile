title: "An Unfinished Idea: A Conference On Emerging Programming Languages"
---

h1. {{ page.title }}

An event to bring together bright folks working on unfinished or recently finished programming languages. Even relatively young languages like Scala would *not* qualify; this event is all about the sharpest part of the cutting edge.

People working on emerging languages:

* Ola Bini ("Ioke":http://ioke.org/")
* Steve Dekorte (assuming he starts working on his post-<a href="http://www.iolanguage.com/">Io</a> language)
* members of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/dd795202.aspx">Axum</a> team
* Adam Chlipala (<a href="http://www.impredicative.com/ur/">Ur</a>)
* Tony Arcieri (<a href="http://wiki.reia-lang.org/wiki/Reia_Programming_Language">Reia</a>)
* why the lucky stiff (<a href="http://hackety.org/potion/">Potion</a>)
* members of the <a href="http://prog.vub.ac.be/amop/">AmbientTalk</a> team
* Chuck Esterbrook (<a href="http://cobra-language.com/">Cobra</a>) - [is the language too old?]
* Jeff Prothero (<a href="http://mythryl.org/">Mythryl</a>)
* Gilad Bracha ("Newspeak":http://bracha.org/Site/Newspeak.html)
* members of the <a href="http://fandev.org/">Fan</a> team</li>
* Philip Mercurio (<a href="http://thyrd.org/">Thyrd</a>)
* Giancarlo Niccolai (<a href="http://falconpl.org/">Falcon)</a>
* Amos Wenger (<a href="http://ooc-lang.org/">ooc</a>)
* members of the <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino/Objective-J</a> team
* members of the <a href="http://piumarta.com/software/cola/">COLA</a> team
* Robert Virding (<a href="http://forum.trapexit.org/viewtopic.php?p=40268">Lisp Flavored Erlang</a>)
* members of the <a href="http://somefancy.com/trylon/">Trylon</a> team
* members of the <a href="http://snow.meta.io/">Snow</a> team
* members of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/noop/">Noop</a> team

It makes sense to schedule the event around JavaOne or another large conference that attracts language-minded developers. The event would likely be held in San Francisco, and would be a single day (including a planned outing in the evening). Target date is mid-2010.
