title: "An Unfinished Idea: The Quiet Bar"

h1. {{ page.title }}

A bar, most likely in Portland, Oregon, that is quiet. A subdued, minimal interior. An atmosphere that encourages intimate conversations. Perhaps even a decibel meter on the wall, to reinforce a sense of controlled volume. Ambient, sometimes generative music played at a low level. Acoustic tiling, if necessary.

Impeccable drinks. Perhaps a way to order without talking to the bartender, without discouraging the friendly social aspects of a bar. Discourage crowding around the bar, encourage table service. Maybe reservations only, like Bourbon & Branch and other speciality bars.

h2. PS: Bars That Have Been Suggested As Similar To The Above

* Milk & Honey, NYC
* The Stumbling Monk, Seattle
* Please Don't Tell (PDT), NYC
* M. Bar, Portland, OR -- though this was disputed
* Secret Society, Portland, OR
* The Doheny, Los Angeles -- apparently requires a wildly expensive annual membership fee
