title: "An Unfinished Idea: The Ambient Music Box"
---

h1. {{ page.title }}

A music box that uses environmental input (light, sound, motion) as a random seed for the generation of ambient sounds or melodies. Ideally, it's small and self-contained, using "Arduino":http://www.arduino.cc/ or "BUG":http://www.buglabs.net/ or a similar open, hackable hardware platform to handle the gritty details.

Open question as to whether it handles its own audio synthesis or triggers from a bank of samples. The granularity and sensitivity of the environmental sensors really makes or breaks the impact of interacting with the piece.<

Inspired by repeated listens to "Satie's Gymnopédie":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnopédie and remixes thereof.
