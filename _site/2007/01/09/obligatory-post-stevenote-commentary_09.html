<h1>Obligatory Post-Stevenote Commentary</h1>
<p>June.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a ways away, but not too long to wait for someone to finally fix mobile phones and get convergence devices right.</p>
<p>The delay itself is not nearly as irksome as what it opens the door for: ignorant speculation, potential <span class="caps">FCC</span> screw-ups, shipping delays, parts scarcity.  In short, there&#8217;s room for the sort of unpleasant launch experience that consumers endured with the recent game consoles.  Cingular, in particular, seems like a weak link in Apple trying to provide their usual seamless consumer experience.</p>
<p>Not to mention all the tiresome conversations that are sure to bog down blogs and cafe conversations alike: &#8220;it&#8217;s too expensive, it doesn&#8217;t hold enough music, I don&#8217;t like Cingular, it doesn&#8217;t have enough battery life.&#8221;  It&#8217;s not that these complaints are without merit, but they don&#8217;t matter in the face of what&#8217;s just happened.</p>
<p>The Motorolas and Nokias of the world can&#8217;t get away with miserable interfaces and pathetic functionality anymore.  Nobody can.  Every phone on the market until the iPhone&#8217;s release is irrelevant.  Whether you&#8217;re actually going to buy an iPhone or not, it means that phones are going to get better.   That&#8217;s way bigger than whether 8GB is enough music for you.  It raises the bar on an entire market.</p>
<p>The thing I&#8217;m most curious about regarding the iPhone is support for third party development.  The thing runs a mini OS X and that&#8217;s a lot of power and development flexibility.  My wild ass prediction: Dashcode will be the development platform for the iPhone.   Widgets appear to be first-class applications in the iPhone&#8217;s interface, and I think that&#8217;s telling.</p>
<p>See?  Speculation.  Ignorant.  So what else?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care about the <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a>.  The only reason we have a TV is for the Wii.  As soon as I can hook that up to my Cinema Display the TV is history.  I don&#8217;t buy DRM&#8217;d content and I don&#8217;t enjoy the iTunes Music Store.  I like the look of the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/">AirPort Extreme</a> they&#8217;re pitching with the Apple TV but my (relatively new) MacBook Pro doesn&#8217;t support it and doesn&#8217;t qualify for a <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/01/09/update-your-wireless-to-802-11n/">firmware update</a>.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t in the least bit surprised about the lack of other hardware announcements, but the total lack of news about Leopard was odd.  I was figuring we&#8217;d hear about some of those mystery features Steve hinted at back during <span class="caps">WWDC</span>, but no.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just not that much more to talk about for the time being, which is weird.  The Stevenote was just so iPhone-dominated, and the iPhone is just so not-here-yet.  It&#8217;s like landing a hot date: you&#8217;re happy about it but really nervous that it&#8217;s going to go badly so you <em>just don&#8217;t want to talk about it</em>.</p>
