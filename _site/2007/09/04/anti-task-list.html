<h1>The Anti Task List</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve never subscribed to <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">Getting Things Done</a> (<span class="caps">GTD</span>) verbatim, but I&#8217;m big on personal organization.  I&#8217;ve been practicing <a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero/">Inbox Zero</a> in an informal way for some time, and more strictly since Merlin codified the practice.  I&#8217;ve pushed Trac, Basecamp, and wikis on coworkers.  I&#8217;ve tried scads of different ways of organizing myself, from a plain ol&#8217; todo.txt to beta fanciness like <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>.  The solution that works best for me is a bit unorthodox.</p>
<p>Much like I believe that <a href="http://al3x.net/2007/07/17/why-this-is-here-and-thats-there.html">there&#8217;s a right place for particular kinds of content</a>, I believe that there&#8217;s a right place for each of your tasks.  That place is in the application that can do the most to benefit that task.  Or, to crib from the esteemed <a href="http://www.torrez.org/">Andre Torrez</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;How about less to-do apps, and more apps that help me do things?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned above, OmniFocus is the most recent organization application I&#8217;ve tried.  It&#8217;s also the best, a great Mac app and a superb implementation of the <span class="caps">GTD</span> approach.  Problem is, OmniFocus is a bit too much fun to use.  I was so eager to get everything into OmniFocus and out of my Gmail/chat/conversation that it became a secondary inbox, albeit a more organized one.  My lists of things to do, books and articles to read, media to download, videos to watch, and songs to listen to quickly grew out of hand.</p>
<p>My remedy was to take out the middleman.  Most applications have queues built into them which can be appropriated as a kind of task list.  <span class="caps">GTD</span> suggests that you define a context for each action, but I found that most of my contexts are virtual, implicit, and intuitive.  That is, when I&#8217;m done with one task and ready for the next, I switch to the application in which I can accomplish my next task.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t create a list of things to blog about, I create drafts; when I have time to write a blog post, I&#8217;ll open up my blog editor.  Similarly, I no longer take the time to create a task to download something and assign that task a &#8220;web&#8221; or &#8220;home&#8221; context.  Instead, I just download that something right now or queue it up in a download manager.  Where possible, I create a <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> rule to take care of filing things away in application-specific queues for me.  If I have a frequent task that I don&#8217;t have a specific tool for, I <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/">find one</a> and make sure that the tool supports some kind of queuing.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s likely no escaping a task list for multi-person projects (read: real work).  For team projects, invest in a tool like <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> and leverage its features and metadata.  Don&#8217;t replicate task lists between collaborative tools and your personal organization system; abolish your personal organization system.  Keeping tasks in a contextual, collaborative application provides them with more value than when jotted on a piece of paper or entered into to-do list software.</p>
<p>Learn your tools well and the task list as an entity disappears.  Instead, you&#8217;ll find yourself prepped and ready to work when you move from one tool to another, always with the next task clearly ahead of you.</p>
