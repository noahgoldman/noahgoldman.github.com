<h1>RubyConf 2007, Day 2: Rubinius 1.0</h1>
<p>The second day of RubyConf began with a grip of talks on alternate Ruby VMs: IronPython (for the .<span class="caps">NET</span> platform), JRuby (for Java), and lastly Rubinius (for great justice).  Sheepishly, admit that I slept through the first two; neither .<span class="caps">NET</span> nor Java are relevant to my interests.</p>
<p>Rubinius, however, is extremely relevant to my interets.  Evan Phoenix &mdash; runner up to Havoc Pennington in the &#8220;best name in Open Source software&#8221; competition and the project&#8217;s founder &mdash; let the science drop about the project&#8217;s pending 1.0 release.</p>
<p>Phoenix has developed a signature presenting style: fast, direct, and punctuated by amusing, colorful slides.  He opens with a brief history of Rubinius&#8217; founding and its origins at a previous RubyConf.  Rubinius has ancestors in Smalltalk&#8217;s implementation and borrows freely from &#8220;crazy compsci papers&#8221;.  At present, the project boasts generational garbage collection, stackless execution, <span class="caps">JAR</span>-style packaging, pre-compiled files, and a host of other exciting features.</p>
<p>The most critical part of Rubinius&#8217; implementation is that a majority of it is written in Ruby.  Rather than being purely C, C#, or Java, Rubinius has only enough C to bootstrap the remainder of the language&#8217;s core being written in Ruby.  Phoenix claims that Rubinius is &#8220;Ruby for Ruby programmers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, Rubinius is beating the standard 1.8.x Ruby implementation in 24 of 31 of the <span class="caps">YARV</span> benchmarks.  Beyond that, Phoenix isn&#8217;t interested in talking about performance at this point in time, as the implementation&#8217;s speed is highly variable at present.</p>
<p>Rubinius isn&#8217;t done yet.  By way of explanation, Phoenix mentions that the project is learning from its mistakes and &#8220;optimizing for fun&#8221;.  Community is stressed as an important part of the project&#8217;s evolution.  Rubinius now boasts 57 committers, of whom 17 have committed frequently.  The project is eager to hand out commit rights to anyone who submits a single patch &mdash; an extremely liberal open source project management style.</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>First up, a hardball: should Rubinius replace <span class="caps">MRI</span> (Matz&#8217;s Ruby interpreter, the standard implementation of the language)?  Phoenix suggests that&#8217;s up to the ecosystem/community to decide what should be the standard.</p>
<p>Can you swap in another kernel?  Yes.  The project has been designed for modularity.</p>
<p>Are there more things you can override?  By way of answer, Phoenix mentions that the entire compiler is written in Ruby, and that it&#8217;s a &#8220;malleable system that can be changed over time.&#8221;  Compiler flags are available to change what decisions the compiler makes.</p>
<p>How small can the kernel be?  The long-term goal is to have zero lines of C code by following some of the self-hosting strategies of Squeak&#8217;s VM.</p>
<p>Concerns about incompatibilities?  &#8220;We try to be as compatible as we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard numbers about the project&#8217;s status and compatibility?  &quot;We&#8217;re down to 500 failing specs.  While <span class="caps">MRI</span> is the main compatibility target, &#8220;we&#8217;re trying to be as agnostic as possible with the specs.&#8221;  The specs are written in a &#8220;mini-RSpec&#8221; implementation that&#8217;s intended to be syntax-compatible with RSpec.</p>
<p>What about the backtrace format?  Phoenix shows a trace that&#8217;s smart about showing the developer where the program actually died, even though the failure involved a method call that bridged two classes.  Rubinius will also be able to provide backtraces for segfaults in C extensions.</p>
<p>What about NextObject?  Haven&#8217;t figured out a good way to do this yet.</p>
<p>Continuations?  Rubinius has first-class method contexts, and Phoenix demos its use.  &#8220;A continuation is just the ability to save a point in time and go back to it&#8221;.  So, in Rubinius, you save a MethodContext and go back to it to implement continuations.</p>
<p>Will MethodContext be serializable?  Yes, but nobody has written it yet.</p>
