<h1>RubyConf 2007, Day 2: Maximizing Productivity</h1>
<p>Eric Hodel, an illustrious Ruby hacker with over 40 projects under his belt, is presenting on how he organizes himself for maximum time spent coding.</p>
<p>Hodel starts by choosing projects carefully and not reinventing the wheel.  He claims not be a &#8220;coding superhero,&#8221; and breaks projects down into small, focused pieces.  His acronym mantra: <span class="caps">YAGNITAGAFI</span>: You Ain&#8217;t Gonna Need It, They Ain&#8217;t Gonna Ask For It.  It&#8217;s important to keep to a clear purpose.</p>
<p>Testing is essential to his process, providing a groundwork for new features and ease of contribution.  Hodel is a fan of autotest, and prefers to keep his entire development process visible.  His desktop is four terminals: code, autotest, and a couple of extra testing windows.  Later in the development process, Hodel uses the heckle mutation tester to ensure his test cases are robust.  Automation is a general theme.</p>
<p>Hodel suggests knowing your editor inside and out, although he doesn&#8217;t recommend a particular editor.  Pair-programming is another suggested tool, including &#8220;ping-pong programming,&#8221; in which two coders go back and forth writing tests and coding to satisfy those tests.</p>
<p>Documentation strategies include a <span class="caps">README</span> with a quick-start guide, a synopsis and feature overview, and a link to the bug tracker.  The bug tracker itself should be set up with categories, groups, and email, and disallow anonymous feedback to allow for follow-up.  RDoc documentation should include examples.</p>
<p>Hodel gets feedback before releasing.  When he&#8217;s ready to release, he uses the hoe tool to automate every step of the process, including uploading to RubyForge and making blog posts.  Hodel suggests minor releases to make bug-hunting simpler, and then taking the time to relax after a release.  &#8220;It&#8217;s no fun to code 24/7.&#8221;  Amen.</p>
<p>Building a community around bug tracking is key.  Beyond that, it&#8217;s worth searching beyond the bug tracker to find reports on mailing lists and blogs.  Responsible bug submissions are stressed: include the steps to reproduce the bug, your platform, etc.  Consistent versioning is suggested.  Hodel uses a major.minor.bugfix convention, and bumps the major version when <span class="caps">API</span> incompatibilities are introduced.  Generally, while he claims to &#8220;write a lot of crappy software,&#8221; he tries not to be concerned about complaints and to encourage contributions.</p>
<p>Hodel finds inspiration in hacking nights and solutions from other communities (ex: the Smalltalk environment&#8217;s test feedback, which inspired autotest).  He also suggests writing &#8220;pain-killers&#8221;: software that solves nagging problems in your work and life.</p>
