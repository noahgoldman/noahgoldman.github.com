<h1>The Emotional Economics of the DC Rental Market</h1>
<p>T and I finally put our months of renting woes to rest today.  We&#8217;re staying at <a href="http://www.equityapartments.com/market/driving.aspx?PropID=1436">Sheffield Court</a> and moving from my tiny studio to a roomy one-bedroom just a couple of buildings away.  Same 1940s garden style three-stories, same sunny view of Route 50, same short walk to Clarendon.  It&#8217;s a known quantity, and one without further move-in fees or other hassles.  We move to the new place next weekend.</p>
<p>Getting to this decision has been an ordeal, or at least a series of disappointments.  The rental market in the DC metro area is, in a word, godawful.  Let me explain.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re young and hip you&#8217;re supposed to live in the city, ideally in an up-and-coming neighborhood like Shaw, Columbia Heights, Logan Circle, or maybe Eastern Market.  The idea is that you&#8217;re so desperate for the &#8220;urban experience&#8221; that you&#8217;ll set all common sense aside and pay a tidy sum to live in a crime-ridden neighborhood while paying taxes to a city government that provides abysmal social services.  Oh, and you&#8217;ll probably be in a group house or an &#8220;English basement&#8221; (read: any basement apartment, it just sounds better with &#8220;English&#8221; in front of it) if you want to have enough money to feed yourself, too.  You don&#8217;t get a vote in the District, but at least you&#8217;ll have license to complain about how rough &#8220;life in the city&#8221; is to all your friends back home.  And really, the whole urban experience only has any mystique for kids who didn&#8217;t grow up near a major city.  Trust me, living next door to real live minorities isn&#8217;t going to change the fact that you&#8217;re white and middle class and bourgeois enough to care.</p>
<p>We saw truly ghastly apartments in both the aforementioned gentrification-magnets and more established neighborhoods like Dupont Circle.  Dark, dank, dirty, and desolate doesn&#8217;t seem to deter real estate agents from renting these hovels to the suckers who line up to compete in application-filling-out speed trials at open houses.  If you&#8217;re ready to brave the lines, get ready for the trade-offs.  You can find 1000 square feet, but no washer, dryer, or dishwasher to take up all that room.  You can find amenities straight out of a chic loft but no room for anything other than granite countertops.  Or, if you have our luck, you&#8217;ll find the perfect place in the perfect location only to be told by an icy would-be landlord that all resident cats must be de-clawed, a practice that every shelter in the area condemns as inhumane and has made contractually illegal.  Renting in the city is all about learning to settle, and settle low.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re young and professional, you&#8217;re supposed to live just outside the city in Northern Virginia, ideally in a neighborhood like Ballston, Old Town Alexandria, Courthouse, Rosslyn, or our own Clarendon.  In these neighborhoods, every high-rise is &#8220;luxury&#8221;, and you&#8217;re lucky to find one that hasn&#8217;t yet turned to condos.  I understand that NoVA attracts prosperous people, but pervasive luxury is a contradiction in terms.  The management companies that run these sorts of buildings seem to think that a marble lobby, a business center, and a litany of outrageous move-in fees is enough to convey &#8220;luxury&#8221;.  We nearly ended up in one of these buildings, but ultimately decided that paying upwards of $1800 a month after pet fees and utilities was a touch steep for a 600-odd square foot studio.  Luxury aside.</p>
<p>Sheffield Court is not luxurious.  They have the obligatory business center tucked away in a squat, old-timey building alongside leasing office.  The appliances, stairwells, and cramped parking all show the community&#8217;s age, and it&#8217;s a puffy uphill walk to the nearest Metro.  Still, it&#8217;s become familiar, and Clarendon has some character beyond the high-rise condos going up every other block.  It&#8217;ll be a fine place to spend another year, by which time we&#8217;ll hopefully be moving on to a city that&#8217;s new for both of us.  That&#8217;s all beside my point, though.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking about moving to the DC area, think twice about the rental market before you invest time, energy, and money into finding a halfway-decent place to live.  And don&#8217;t think you can escape to the suburbs or exurbs; I haven&#8217;t even started on the commuter situation.</p>
