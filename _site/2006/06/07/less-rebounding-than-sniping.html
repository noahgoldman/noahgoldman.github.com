<h1>Less Rebounding Than Sniping</h1>
<p><a href="http://singlestat.us/">SingleStat.us</a> is eBay sniping for relationships.  You tell it to watch a MySpace profile and it tells you when the relationship status has changed.  The idea, of course, is that you&#8217;ll be the first to know when the person you&#8217;ve had your eye on leaves his or her boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife/polygamist household/etc.</p>
<p>What a boon.  Gone are the days of actually having to feign occasional conversation to find out if that special someone you want to shtup has left whatever assuredly incompetent, worthless person they&#8217;ve oh-so-temporarily decided to shack up with.  Why wait to ask  leading questions about her availability when you can be positively mercenary about the whole affair?  It&#8217;s the <span class="caps">NSA</span> approach to hooking up.</p>
<p>All sarcasm aside, I&#8217;m disgusted not only that this service exists but that prominent community blogs like TechCrunch  were so quick to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/06/05/find-out-when-your-friends-become-single/">link to it</a>.  Some people are worried about the <a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/columns/2006/06/03/web_2_privacy/1.html">privacy implications of Web 2.0</a>, that our identities are being commodified.  When I see services like this I&#8217;m worried that our identities aren&#8217;t <em>worth</em> commodifying.  Do you think you can build a valuable, lasting customer relationship with someone who&#8217;s eager enough for the next hot thing that she&#8217;d use SingleStat.us?  It&#8217;s the very metric of shallowness, fickleness, vanity, and hubris.</p>
<p>Not unsettled yet?  Take a look at the <a href="http://singlestat.us/latest.php">people being monitored</a> and note the steady stream of married men and women.  If this was all college kids looking to see when week-long campus romances had dissolved, that&#8217;d be one thing.  But the idea that nothing, not a serious commitment, not even a ring on a finger will dissuade some people from their pursuits and obsessions is deeply disturbing to me.</p>
<p>Maybe it didn&#8217;t take Web 2.0 to commodify our identitiesâ€”and our sexuality.  Maybe we&#8217;ve always been ready to swoop in and &#8220;buy up&#8221; the desirables around us.</p>
