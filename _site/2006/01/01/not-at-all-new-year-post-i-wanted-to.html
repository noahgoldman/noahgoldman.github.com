<h1>Not At All The New Year&#8217;s Post I Wanted To Write</h1>
<p>A few weeks ago I got the urge to modify my personal appearance.  This happens periodically, usually in tandem with my seasonality.  I&#8217;ve been through a couple body modifications which I&#8217;ve retired for various reasons:</p>
<p>Both earlobes, stretched to 00ga (large enough to thread headphone cable through).  Retired due to a recurring hypertrophic scar on my left ear.  I miss my big lobes, and often consider another dermatological venture at having the scar removed.</p>
<p>The cartilage of my left ear, dermal punched at a gauge I&#8217;ve since forgotten/repressed.  Retired the day I had it done due to intensive bleeding, caused dually by poor vein sighting on the part of my piercer and my attempt to remove the jewelry entirely too soon.  I got stitched up by a patient young ER doc, one of the more humiliating experiences of my life.</p>
<p>This time around I decided to try two lip piercings (labrets), positioned equidistant below my lower lip, a configuration known as &#8220;snakebites&#8221;.  My piercer did a fine job this past Monday, but they&#8217;ve been increasingly uncomfortable.  Slightly longer jewelry would likely give the wound more room to heal, but I was duly warned that basically any oral piercing is a recipe for tooth and/or gum damage.  As the rightmost piercing began to settle into position I could feel it scraping against my teeth.  No good.  I took them out a few minutes ago to a mix of physical relief and aesthetic regret.</p>
<p>Body modification is a funny thing, something I have as mixed a relationship to as my body itself.  Modification can be a celebration of the body, and I love browsing the galleries at <a href="http://www.bmezine.com"><span class="caps">BME</span></a> and seeing all the shiny, happy, modded people.  But it can also be a form of identity escapism, a means to divert attention from what really matters about yourself.</p>
<p>As I mulled over the usual new year&#8217;s resolutions, I wondered if my energy was best spent fretting over having the right jewelry in my oozing, self-inflicted wounds or getting more exercise, eating better, meditating, and generally doing things that will actually make me feel better.  I suppose it&#8217;s not an inherently either/or proposition for most people, but it&#8217;s always been one for me.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s to a healthy, albeit lamentably snakebite-free new year.  And no, this doesn&#8217;t preclude more tattoos.  Those always make me feel better.</p>
