<article class="post">
<h1>Blog Date</h1>
<p>A friend of mine is moving to a new city.  As part of his moving plans he did what any savvy person should do: look for bloggers in this new city.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots to learn from people who write about a place daily, or even from people who primarily write on other topics but whose accounts are informed by where they live.  Most cities have an all-encompassing group blog or two, some arts and entertainment blogs, food blogs, and so forth.  Essentially, all the sections of a well-rounded local newspaper can be found in weblogs, but reported on a more personal and informal level, making them a great compliment to more traditional sources of information on civic life.  Then there are the aforementioned individual bloggers.</p>
<p>My friend found a blog written by a young lady who shared many of his tastes and interests.  On a whim, he asked her out to dinner when he arrives in the city.  She enthusiastically agreed.</p>
<p>As someone who&#8217;s frequently thinking about ways we can better connect with others in an age of constricting, tick-the-boxes, multiple choice online dating, I was captivated by this annecdote.  What better way to get to know someone than through their blog?</p>
<p>Blog-like journals are already a feature of a number of social networking sites, but they seem like an afterthought.  The average MySpace &#8220;blog&#8221; is like a LiveJournal distilled to its most shallow and reprehensible.  The blog features on explicitly dating-centric sites like <a href="http://personals.theonion.com/">The Onion Personals</a> go practically unused.</p>
<p>The dating world doesn&#8217;t need another personals site embracing blogs.  Rather, &#8220;blog dates&#8221; like the one my friend is looking forward to should become commonplace.  Right now, asking out a blogger you admire is sort of a stalkerish thing to do, but that&#8217;s largely because there&#8217;s no social protocol or precedent for it.  Hopefully that will change.</p>
<p>In my eyes, telling a blogger &#8220;hey, I love what you write every day, and you look kinda cute in that 200Ã—100 pixel photo on your site&#8221; seems a lot less shallow than picking up a random attractive stranger at a bar.  A blog date starts from mutual intellectual respect, and that&#8217;s a healthy thing.</p>
<p>Go forth, then, and mack.  The only thing you have to lose are your TrackBacks.</p>
