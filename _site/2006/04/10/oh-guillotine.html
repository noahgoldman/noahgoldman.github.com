<h1>Oh Guillotine</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I found a record that I just couldn&#8217;t stop listening to.  Longer still since I found two.</p>
<p>For the past week my headphones have been, as they say, <em>pwned</em> by <a href="http://www.britishseapower.co.uk/">British Sea Power</a>.  Day after day I&#8217;ve been listening first to <em>The Decline of British Sea Power</em>, then <em>Open Season</em>, then selected songs from each, and then repeating the whole affair mere hours later.  For someone who prides himself on constantly listening to new music this is distressing behavior.</p>
<p>These two records are a little too good.  Such a relatively young band should not be capable of such exceptional melodic construction and lyrical depth.  If both records weren&#8217;t so hopeful, human, and blissed-out I&#8217;d suggest that something sinister is afoot.  I&#8217;m not convinced that lead singer and lyricist Jan didn&#8217;t strike a Faustian bargain: &#8220;oh, sure, you&#8217;ll make two brilliant records, but the second track on the first record has to have a Dosteyevsky thing going on.  Bwahahahahaha!&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re taken with the historical bent of The Decemberists, imagine more rock, more musical diversity and risk-taking, more smarts, and more swearing.  Take these lyrics from &#8220;Be Gone&#8221; on <em>Open Season</em>:</p>
Agonic lines, ascendances and amatory tendencies
From here to heart arrhythmias
Oh don&#8217;t you know we&#8217;re not like this
Oh Floreal
Oh guillotine
Oh Floreal
I love your iridescent sheen
As it reflects you and it reflects me
<p>Floreal, if you didn&#8217;t know (I sure didn&#8217;t) is the eighth month in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_Calendar">French Republican Calendar</a>.  Yeah.  But it&#8217;s not all that dense.  &#8220;To Get To Sleep&#8221; is full of simple themes and simpler rhymes; it&#8217;s just about as literal as it gets:</p>
Melatonin, a little dose, takes things to a peaceful close
Commerce runs through your veins
And takes you from this waking plane
Industry on your side
To do what you do, when you get tired
Eight hours a day â€“ call it twenty years
There&#8217;s a place you can go
Free of lust, cupidity and fear
<p>Lyrics aside, British Sea Power can freak the fuck out.  &#8220;Lately&#8221; off their first record is a thirteen minute epic that closes in searing feedback, desperate shouting, and drum kit chaos.  Somehow it all manages to stay in the Q And Not U realm of palatable dissonance.  I&#8217;m kicking myself for not knowing about them and seeing them live sooner.  God knows what crazy shit they used to do with that track.</p>
<p>Anyway.  A band love affair is a peculiar thing, and though I hope you&#8217;ll share my enthusiasm chances are good that British Sea Power just won&#8217;t strike you the same way.  Not everyone wants to sing along to songs about the Trojan Horse, and that&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>So what records or artists can you listen to endlessly?</p>
