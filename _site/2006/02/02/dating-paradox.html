<h1>The Dating Paradox</h1>
<p>To say that this <a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/dating.html">n+1 piece on dating</a> is provocative is an understatement.  It&#8217;s not scholarly per se, but it&#8217;s not strictly an opinion piece and it&#8217;s certainly no advice column.  Whatever it is, I&#8217;m all about it.  I&#8217;m having to refrain from quoting vast swaths, or echoing its sentiments nearly verbatim.</p>
<p>My overwhelming sentiment after reading the piece is that modern dating is analogous to modern education: a deeply flawed, ritualized institution that everyone suffers through because <em>it&#8217;s just what people do</em>.  Neither institution is completely broken; people still fall in love and get married, and people still graduate and find jobs.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re going about either in the best and most humane way.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned to enjoy dating about as much as I can.  An average date is about as entertaining for me as, say, seeing a halfway-decent movie.  But, just as I would choose reading a good novel or making music over watching a so-so film, I&#8217;d rather be in a meaningful relationship than trapped in the stasis-loop of auditing evermore potential partners.  Which bring us to the bit I will stoop to quoting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The only way to stop dating is to fall in love. But how, under conditions of dating, would this be possible? You are affected by all the dates you&#8217;ve been on, the relationships you&#8217;ve had.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the author offers no solution to this paradox is telling.  And really, falling in love isn&#8217;t always a solution.  What if he or she doesn&#8217;t love you back?  What if you fall out of love?  It never, ever ends.</p>
<p>In a year-end roundup of ideas for the next century (the publication and author depressingly escapes me), one prediction was that a sort of polyamory would come to be accepted.  Not polyamory in the Mormon or tribal sense, but a gradual cultural acceptance that people can and do love many other people, often simultaneously.  Some societies &#8211; the French come to mind &#8211; have an informal culture of mistresses and lovers that amounts to a tacit, unspoken acceptance of this aspect of human nature.  Embracing polyamory doesn&#8217;t sit well with the strict monogamist in me, but it&#8217;s more of a solution to the &#8220;dating problem&#8221; than I&#8217;ve heard elsewhere.</p>
