<h1>Car Free</h1>
<p>After months of trying, I finally sold my car this past Friday.</p>
<p>For all the hassles of selling one&#8217;s car privately it went pretty well, though it baffles me that the bank I had my car loan with (BB&#38;T) had no facilities to transfer a newly lien-free title expediently.  What buyer is going to be comfortable handing over a chunk of cash and then waiting around for 10+ days for the new title to show up?  Honestly.  Banks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a burden lifted not to be saddled with car payments, insurance payments, ever-higher gas prices, and the general feeling of anchorage imposed by large and costly personal property.  That&#8217;s less an indictment of owning cars than of taking on debt to own a largely impractical car.</p>
<p>As largely impractical cars go, though, the <a href="http://autos.yahoo.com/newcars/mitsubishi_eclipse_gs_2006/17218/style_overview.html">2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS</a> I owned was nothing but pleasant.  It had no mechanical problems in the year I owned it, accommodated a couple of improbable loads in its time, and always offered its absurd stereo system to maximum bass advantage.  I bought it to make my daily commute &#8211; when I had one &#8211; more bearable, and that it did.</p>
<p>In the years previous to the Eclipse I drove a hand-me-down Honda Civic.  My future cars will undoubtedly tend back towards that practical end of the vehicle spectrum.  I&#8217;ll miss the perception afforded you on the road when you drive a sportier car:  I found that fellow motorists are more likely to give you a wide berth and yield the fast lane.  It&#8217;s a convenience, but not one worth the expense of a sporty car.</p>
<p>For the time being I can walk, bike, and Metro most everywhere I  need to go.  When we return from London I&#8217;ll probably sign up for <a href="http://www.zipcar.com">Zipcar</a> for weekend Trader Joe&#8217;s runs and such, but I intend to put off owning a car again for as long as possible.  Until the auto industry can deliver to US consumers practicality, design, post-petroleum fuel efficiency, and low environmental impact in an affordable package, I&#8217;m simply not interested.</p>
