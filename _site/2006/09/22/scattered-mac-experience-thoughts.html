<h1>Scattered Mac Experience Thoughts</h1>
<p>Trouble focusing on a Friday afternoon.  Thoughts until a pot of jasmine and some dubstep settles my mind:</p>
<p>All-encompassing organization tools like <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">Yojimbo</a> and <a href="http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/">DevonThink</a> don&#8217;t make sense to me.  Why would I trust my essential data to a proprietary app built on a data store that&#8217;s been less thoroughly tested than the filesystem?  Being able to assign multiple labels or having semantic linkages guessed at doesn&#8217;t sell it in the age of Spotlight.  Why do these apps insist on duplicating other features: text editing, encryption (Keychain), <span class="caps">RSS</span> reading, web browsing, bookmarking?  Every problem domain has its own method of organization; amalgamating them just produces a single point of failure.</p>
<p>How I stay organized: I put things in logical hierarchies of directories and then use the right application to search through those directories.  Outboard brain lives in text files, edited in a <a href="http://www.macromates.com">TextMate</a>.  Pictures in sub-dirs in the Pictures folder, just use Preview or Finder slideshows.  Useful PDFs and web archives in topical sub-dirs of a &#8220;Knowledge&#8221; folder.</p>
<p>Mail and iCal feel like loss-leaders for .Mac, and nobody I know wants to use .Mac when they can use Gmail and Google Calendar.  I tried switching to Mail and was surprised by its clumsiness, didn&#8217;t last an hour with it.  Leopard shows no sign of fixing any of Mail&#8217;s flaws (or, really, email&#8217;s flaws) and instead tacks on dumb features like stationary.  Encouraging more <span class="caps">HTML</span>-ridden email should be punishable by flogging.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use any calendaring app regularly: my life isn&#8217;t too complicated if I can&#8217;t remember what happens in the next seven days, and I prefer calendars strictly for longview planning and keeping track of friends.  Until I can share my iCal with friends as easily as I can in Google Calendar, it&#8217;s out.  CalDAV support in Leopard&#8217;s iCal may fix that, but I want iCal to be out of the way most of the time.</p>
<p>Is Apple losing its touch with information management, or are desktop apps simply unable to deliver in the post-Google world?  Being able to drag and drop between apps just ain&#8217;t enough anymore.  Where&#8217;s the integration, the desktop advantage that keeps us all from running a stripped-down Linux distro that boots straight into Firefox?</p>
<p>I continued to use <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a> for well over a week but I missed Inquisitor and the general Apple fit-n-finish of Safari.  Ditching PithHelmet and upgrading <a href="http://haoli.dnsalias.com">Saft</a> improved performance and plugged some leakiness.  Little things about OmniWeb feel experimental.  It&#8217;d be nice if Drosera and the <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org/">WebKit nightly builds</a> didn&#8217;t conflict with Saft.  I mean, shit, just <em>don&#8217;t load it</em> if you know enough about the problem to harangue the user with an alert and die.</p>
<p>Apps like OmniWeb and <a href="http://www.adiumx.com">Adium</a> clearly do more than their Apple counterparts.  Safari and iChat require extensions like Saft and <a href="http://www.ksuther.com/chax/">Chax</a> to be up to snuff, but they make banal aesthetic decisions for you.  Somewhere down the line &#8220;power user&#8221; got confused with &#8220;spends all day picking themes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The iPod management screen in iTunes 7 is nice.  It also looks straight out of Windows Vista.</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://www.xtorrentp2p.com/">Xtorrent</a> as much as I like other David Watanabe apps, which is to say a metric asston, but web search APIs mean you don&#8217;t have to embed a browser into your app.</p>
<p>FileVault, secure virtual memory, keychain, password on wake from sleep and screensaver: use &#8217;em.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s about enough of that.</p>
