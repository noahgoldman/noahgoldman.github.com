<h1>Y&#8217;all Be Acting Way Too Tough; Throw On a Suit, Get It Tapered Up</h1>
<p>My relation to fashion is changing.  (Yeah, this is a gonna be a shallow post.)<br />
Time was, you wouldn&#8217;t catch me dead in a collared shirt unless it was $2 from a thrift store and &#8220;matched&#8221; a spiked bracelet I was wearing that day.  I went through the later part of middle school and a fair portion of high school in punk-cum-raver garb, rocking record label t-shirts and phat pants.  I had a few pieces of passable dress-casual clothing for work, but being in the tech industry nobody ever really dictated a dress code to me.  And it&#8217;s not like coming into the office in chinos and a polo does a fat lot of good towards looking passable if you&#8217;ve got 2ga spiked tapers in your ears.</p>
<p>I got in the habit of keeping a very small wardrobe, even by straight guy standards.  This was an extension of my overall minimal/portable lifestyle, the product of bouncing between parents&#8217; houses and spending a good many months in preparation to run off (whole &#8216;nother story, folks).  By the end of high school and my first year of college I got by on about three pairs of jeans, a pair of nice black slacks, a very small assortment of shirts and sweaters, and maybe three pairs of shoes.  When friends who shop at American Eagle tell you that a few more clothes wouldn&#8217;t hurt, you&#8217;re wearing your threads out.</p>
<p>But in the last few months I&#8217;ve gotten tired of the same old shabby casual sweaters, slouchy jeans, and generic black t-shirts that I got by on throughout my freshman year.  Maybe it&#8217;s being back in the city once or twice a week for work, or maybe it&#8217;s just growing the fuck up, but I&#8217;m increasingly uncomfortable in public unless smartly dressed.  Even if it&#8217;s a t-shirt and jeans kinda day, it&#8217;s gotta be a nice fitted t-shirt and decent jeans.  But most of the time I much prefer something AX, Kenneth Cole, <span class="caps">DKNY</span>, and so forth.  I&#8217;m not rocking Gucci on a student&#8217;s budget, but if I had the money for it (and enough left over to ease my conscience through charity, something I already do), I probably would.</p>
<p>There are a couple caveats to all this.  For one, it&#8217;s not like this is the first time in my life I&#8217;ve dressed well.  I&#8217;ve always had a couple sharp pieces of clothing on hand, and even my casual selections fit a respectably hip urban color scheme.  And further, I still shy away from paying exorbitant sums for shitty fashion, like Diesel.  In DC&#8217;s upscale Georgetown shopping district last night I couldn&#8217;t tell the difference between the crap in Diesel and the drab indie uniform garb in Urban Outfitters, save that some of the Diesel stuff looked more uncomfortable.  I&#8217;m still only willing to pay for what I think is worthwhile, and thankfully even cheapie <a href="http://www.hm.com/">H&amp;M</a> can do right by me in that respect.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s odd being well-dressed on my campus.  I feel out of place until I Metro into DC for work and suddenly: people who give a shit about their appearance.  It&#8217;s odder still being a straight male techie who dresses well; hackers I meet are suspect of my abilities until we get to talking.  And lastly, it&#8217;s odd being into (though not exclusively) <a href="http://suicidegirls.com/">SuicideGirls</a> -lookin&#8217; ladies when you&#8217;re all Kenneth Cole.  It&#8217;s tough to find alt-girls who aren&#8217;t looking for a scruffy never-be rockstar boy, and tougher still to find stylish girls who aren&#8217;t shallow or overdressed.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any fashion guilt, though.  It&#8217;s disingenuous for upper-middle class kids to be going around in trashy indie clothes as pricey as something sharp just to claim some sort of proletariat solidarity.  There needn&#8217;t be a disconnect between looking elegant and professional and having a social conscience.</p>
<p>So these days, I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.ohhla.com/anonymous/jigga/theblack/whatmore.jyz.txt">with the Jigga Man</a> on this one: &#8220;I can&#8217;t let a day go by without me bein&#8217; fly or fresh to death/Head to toe &#8216;til the day I rest/And I don&#8217;t wear [raver pants], I&#8217;m [twenty] plus/Give me a crisp pair of jeans, nigga, button up.&#8221;  What more can I say?</p>
