<h1>You Know My Life</h1>
<p>Friday: code for <a href="http://www.picnet.net/">work</a>.  Drive down to VA to get audio kit from <a href="http://www.5dots.net/">5dots</a> and hit the <a href="http://www.dc2600.info/">DC 2600</a> meeting with <a href="http://www.timeporn.net/">Phil</a>.  Ran into some old timers, some (relatively) new regulars.  Slow meeting, but some good conversation in there.  Get home around 3am.</p>
<p>Saturday: tried to record the vocals to those lyrics I mentioned the other day.  I didn&#8217;t hate my voice, and was actually fairly inspired melody-wise, but the <span class="caps">USB</span> audio interface I used had terrible distortion on it and the vocals were unusable.  Also the room I was recording in had too much fan noise.  Went back to the apartment and coded for work, making great wonderful leaps.  Went out to <a href="http://www.sonar.us/">Sonar</a>, alone, to see <a href="http://www.dj-db.com/">DJ DB</a> and had the first really good time at a dance night I&#8217;ve had in a long time, basically since I&#8217;ve had to dance alone.  DB played his superb blend of jungle over an excellent two-hour set, never getting locked into one sub-genre or style, nor playing more than just the right anthems (was quite happy to hear that &#8220;by the power of Ra!&#8221; track, not to mention just a couple minutes of the &#8220;We Want Your Soul&#8221; remix).  Left dripping sweat and very happy.  Got home around 3am.</p>
<p>Sunday (today): woke up a little stiff from from the previous evening&#8217;s booty shaking.  Burned a few extra <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora</a> Core 1 CDs, got some Atkins-friendly food to have for lunch later, and went over to the campus Engineering building for the <a href="http://lug.umbc.edu/&#39;s"><span class="caps">UMBC</span> Linux User Group</a> semesterly Installfest.  Spent over six hours handing many, many installs (30+?) on a variety of hardware.  Fun, rewarding, but tiring.  Had dinner at the local Double T diner with some campus friends who helped out at the Installfest.  Talked geek, felt good.  Expect to be in bed well before 3am.</p>
<p>Tomorrow (Monday): code for work all day until class in the evening.  Very excited about this code.  Also, sorting out nasty Apache problems, which I enjoy thoroughly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a life, and it&#8217;s a living.</p>
