<h1>Opportunity</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked myself sick over the last week or so, barely finding time to attend to midterms.  The reason for that is because this weekend my employers, <a href="http://www.picnet.net/">PICnet</a>, will be at <span class="caps">MIT</span> talking about what we&#8217;re doing and the software I&#8217;ve been building for them.  I&#8217;ll write more about that in another post.  This post is for me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve waffled a lot about where I want to be in my life, and most of that confusion has made its way here.  I&#8217;ve at least settled on where I&#8217;m going to live: in downtown DC, sharing a flat with <a href="http://www.superfuturecity.com/">Phil</a>, which should work out well on all fronts.  I can&#8217;t do dorm life, the on-campus apartments are little better, and the prospect of living alone in Baltimore is a bit too grim to act on.  DC is my home, and it&#8217;ll be nice to live there again.</p>
<p>I made this living decision expecting to be commuting to school, but again I&#8217;m waffling about where I want to be regarding my education.  I mused here some time ago that I could (continue to) get the kind of work I want without finishing school, but it was only idle speculation at that point.  But now I <em>have</em> the job I want, the kind of job I&#8217;m supposedly getting an education to be able to get.  And it&#8217;s put me in a very frustrating place.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t do my job to the fullest capacity because of school.  I wouldn&#8217;t be sick right now if I didn&#8217;t have to attend to school as well as work; I&#8217;d be exhausted, sure, but not sick.  My classes this semester aren&#8217;t the annoyance they&#8217;ve previously been, but rather a side-interest, like a good work of non-fiction you read in bed after a long day at the office.  I&#8217;m engaged by school, but not inspired to work myself crazy like I am for this job.</p>
<p>I <em>love</em> what I&#8217;m doing; I&#8217;ve never been more motivated in my life.</p>
<p>Our company is in a pretty good place, and though I don&#8217;t want count my chickens before they hatch, I think things are only going to get better.  I&#8217;m going to ride out this semester at school, continuing to put in part-time consultant&#8217;s hours, and see where things are come summer.  I just have this gut instinct that if I don&#8217;t give everything I&#8217;ve got to what we&#8217;re doing I&#8217;m going to regret it.  The choice is mine, as my employers are incredibly accommodating, so we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>
