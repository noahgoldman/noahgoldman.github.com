<h1>Good InfoSec Deed For The Day</h1>
<p>I was in my school&#8217;s commons building this afternoon, reading, when I overheard a young man trying to sell a discount salon package to two young women and their male companion sitting to my left.  Since we&#8217;d had a rash of scams the previous semester (kids selling bogus tickets to a comedy club on false behalf of our <span class="caps">SGA</span>) I was skeptical as I listened to his pitch.  Right about when he was putting on the sale-closing pressure, mentioning that he took cash, checks, or credit, I walked over and politely interrupted.  I mentioned to them the scams from last semester and suggested they give the salon he was promoting a call before paying for anything.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t stay to see if they completed the sale or not, but I was thanked by the targets of the sales pitch before they left.  They hadn&#8217;t seen the scams reported but found my interruption very helpful.  The young man with the two girls confided in me that he found the whole thing a little sketchy, but the salesman was just so pressuring.</p>
<p>It amazes me that people don&#8217;t really think about their personal information security, even with all the publicity that identity theft gets these days.  I was happy, if a little embarrassed, to be able to give someone a heads-up, and happier still that they didn&#8217;t think I was a crazy, nosy jerk.</p>
