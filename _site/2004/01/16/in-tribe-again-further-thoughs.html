<h1>In The Tribe Again: Further Thoughs</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased with my decision to get back on Tribe.net from an information-gathering perspective: I&#8217;ve gotten lots of good Atkins advice, music reccomendations, and other generally provocative info.  The interface and performance of the site has improved dramatically since I was last on, and barring omissions like <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds of discussions and expiring old/unused tribes (I&#8217;ve suggested both in the Tribe Ideas tribe to much agreement) the system works great.</p>
<p>The people are still broken, though.  I have to forcibly stop myself from looking at most people&#8217;s profiles, searching for people, following links from one person to another, and so forth.  If I see another person with &#8220;sex&#8221; or &#8220;kissing&#8221; or &#8220;women/girls/men/boys&#8221; listed in their Interests I&#8217;m going to start breaking virtual heads.  The site still does nothing to keep people from being themselves (read: assholes), and I see that as a major flaw.  Sarcasm?  Uh, sure.</p>
<p>The reality is that these sites are going to attract basically six kinds of people:</p>
<ol>
	<li>People who can&#8217;t meet people in meatspace because of serious issues.</li>
	<li>People who don&#8217;t want to meet people in meatspace, just catalog virtual friends.</li>
	<li>People who want to catalog their meatspace friends virtually to remind themselves how many friends they have.</li>
	<li>People with alternative lifestyles and apparently no other hobbies or interests who want to catalog other people sharing their lifestyle.</li>
	<li>People out for casual sex.</li>
	<li>People out to be disruptive jerks in cyberspace because they&#8217;ll get the hell beaten out of them in meatspace, and rightly so.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sure, I&#8217;m hamming it up a bit, but online communities definitely attract some jerks, and some communities or types of communities more than others.  Social networking sites seem to be industrial strength asshat magnets.</p>
<p>That makes it tough for the rest of us.  I feel like I&#8217;m being a good Tribe &#8220;citizen&#8221;:</p>
<ol>
	<li>I keep my profile informative and comma-delineated, as requested, for easy searching;</li>
	<li>I only join tribes for actual things I&#8217;m actually into that I can actually contribute to;</li>
	<li>I don&#8217;t start or join bullshit tribes (&#8220;<strong>*</strong>!!!&#8221; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;* super nuclear monkey knifefights lol**!!&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;!&quot;);</li>
	<li>I&#8217;ve posted a genuine event in the apropos tribe and offered to meet random new Tribes&#8217;ers at said event;</li>
	<li>My discussion posts are in the right thread or sub-thread&#8230;</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, I&#8217;m reaching with that last one.  Still, one gets the sense looking around Tribe that it&#8217;s like Singapore taken over by anarchists (not cool Sex Pistols ones, either): a rule-bound domain that once worked exceedingly well due to its restrictive nature, now derelict with free-riders, idiots, and prostitutes.  I just want to use the system for what it&#8217;s intended: meeting new people, doing new things, finding out new information, and maybe selling a couch.</p>
<p>Having long since given up on online dating sites, I&#8217;m hoping to use Tribe to make new just-friends and get out.  My one ray of hope to this end is the product of a search for my school, <span class="caps">UMBC</span>.  Amidst the usual slag of bullshit profiles and bullshit people (&#8220;Occupation: professional system fucker-upper&#8221;, &#8220;Here for: yr boyfriend!!! lol rofl!!&#8221;) I found one seemingly nice person and wrote him/her for advice on what to do in and around Baltimore, since I intend to spend less time fleeing to DC this coming semester.  This personal actually wrote me back with some suggestions and even a casual, passing invitation to hang out.  So for all my bitching, the system <em>can</em> work.</p>
<p>Just rarely.</p>
