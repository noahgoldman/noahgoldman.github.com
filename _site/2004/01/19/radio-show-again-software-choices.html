<h1>Radio Show Again, Software Choices</h1>
<p>When the semester starts up in (eep!) a matter of days I&#8217;ll be back to doing a radio show at UMBC&#8217;s on-campus station, <a href="http://wmbc.umbc.edu/"><span class="caps">WMBC</span></a>.  Rather than just one night a week, however, I&#8217;ll be polluting the airwaves <a href="http://wmbc.umbc.edu/schedule.php">twice a week</a>: 8-9PM on Tuesdays and 7-8PM on Thursday.  Tuesday will be reserved for genre explorations, as per my show last year, and Thursday will just be me playing whatever I&#8217;m feelin&#8217;.  My show&#8217;s name is Selection 3, for pretty obvious reasons.  And yeah, they have MP3 streams, so you&#8217;ve got no excuse but to listen.  Expect an electronic bent, but not without occasional indie, post-punk, hip-hop, dub, and rap forays.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to figure out what to spin the shows with.  Thursdays I may just play tracks out of iTunes or off my iPod for simplicity and my sanity.  But Tuesdays I would prefer to do &#8220;real&#8221; mixes, though obviously not on vinyl.  The station has a rather beat-up DJ setup, but I have neither the wax collection nor any interest in keeping Final Scratch with its lousy library functions, <a href="http://www.al3x.net/mt/archives/000447.html">expensive upgrades</a>, and difficult set-up.  However, I&#8217;m thinking of taking advantage of the DJ mixer and employing one of a couple other DJ software packages.</p>
<p>The software that Final Scratch was built off, Traktor DJ Studio 2, has improved quite a bit since I last looked at it.  The 2.5 series is actually much improved over TraktorFS, which was overtaking its parent software in stability for some time.  For whatever reason I find &#8220;pure&#8221; digital DJing a much more natural fit for my mixing style, and Traktor is the benchmark digital DJ application.  Version 2.5 adds a host of neat features and interface improvements, but like TraktorFS its library could stand to be improved, but that too has improved from the pre-2.5 series.</p>
<p>Traktor now has the ability (finally!) to route output through multiple CoreAudio-supported audio interfaces.  This feature alone makes the software seem worth paying for (at an academic discount, anyway).  Rather than shelling out for the software <em>and</em> a bulky, expensive, crappy multichannel <span class="caps">USB</span> or Firewire audio interface you can just use a $40 <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/imic/index.html">Griffin iMic</a> and the built-in headphone output on your laptop.  Route those through a hardware DJ mixer and get mixin&#8217;.  Keen.  I intend to work the hell out of the demo before I put any of my ex-FinalScratch cash towards Traktor, as I&#8217;m wary of more Native Instruments nonsense, but I think 2.5 has improved the application enough to make it a solid buy.</p>
<p>I explored open source alternative <a href="http://www.sonophile.com/">DeKstasy</a> last night as well, and while it&#8217;s come a long way from earlier versions I&#8217;ve tested, it has a long way yet to go.  Most puzzling is the author&#8217;s decision to break the application up into panes, with only one pane visible at a time.  This means, for example, that you can&#8217;t simultaneously view the progress of a playing track and your virtual mixer.  While that isn&#8217;t a problem in the output scenario with a hardware mixer described above, it makes a entirely software set quite difficult.  The program abounds with such odd separation of interface and functionality, such as separate panes for importing tracks (a time-consuming and cumbersome process) and organizing them into virtual crates.  DeKstasy does offer <span class="caps">AAC</span> support, unlike Traktor, and is no slouch in the <span class="caps">BPM</span> matching department either.  For the price of <em>free</em> one could learn to live with its eccentricities.  Given the choice between it and Traktor, however, I have to overlook open code for features and performance and go with Traktor.  Improvements down the road may change that verdict.</p>
<p>A final option, and one I&#8217;ve explored before, is using my beloved Ableton Live for an odd sort of DJing, half pre-prepared and half improvised.  While I&#8217;ve read that Live can make a fine DJ tool, it has no MP3 support, and thus tracks must be converted to <span class="caps">WAV</span> or <span class="caps">AIFF</span> ahead of set-building time.  This is hardly more cumbersome than DeKstasy&#8217;s awkward importing process, but a damn sight less spontaneous than Traktor&#8217;s ability to mix any MP3 you throw at it.  Live as well requires a multichannel audio interface for pre-listening, making its use as a DJ tool an investment of both time and money.</p>
<p>The devil is in the details.  Whatever software I decide to work with behind the scenes, rest assured that hype mixes are on the way.</p>
