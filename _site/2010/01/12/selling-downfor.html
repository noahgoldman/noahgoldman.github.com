<h1>Sold, For Just Me</h1>
<p>A while back, I noticed friends on an online community repeatedly asking &#8220;is <em>some site</em> down for everyone, or just me?&#8221; This odd scenario, in which users of the same global Internet have an inconsistent view of the network, is often caused by local ISPs having outdated <span class="caps">DNS</span> caches. Being able to check with a third-party often lead to the conclusion that, no, some major site was not down, your Internet connection just sucked.</p>
<p>One morning, I was inspired enough by seeing this plaintive inquiry for the umpteenth time to throw together the absolute bare minimum web service to check to see if a given site was up or down. I got it working, picked out a <a href="http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/">cheekily literal domain name</a>, tweeted about it, and left it at that. Over the course of the following weeks, the site was linked to from a number of popular blogs and link aggregators. Before long, it was climbing the Alexa rankings.</p>
<p>I had numerous feature requests after the site launched, but turning it into a robust, multi-homed uptime checker was never my goal. All I&#8217;ve ever done with the site is:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ported it from a simple Ruby implementation to <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">App Engine</a>.</li>
	<li>Put some ads on it; first Google AdWords, then later individual campaigns that I negotiated by email. I made about <span class="caps">USD</span> $300/month from the site, on average.</li>
	<li>Wired up a <a href="http://twitter.com/downfor">Twitter account</a> that would tweet out sites that were frequently seen by the service as &#8220;down&#8221; within a short time period. (This functionality has been inactive since November, 2008.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the site&#8217;s popularity, it&#8217;s sort of silly to let it lie so fallow. I have no inclination towards improving the site, and it deserves an owner with an active interest in its improvement.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, I sold Downfor to <a href="http://www.bweeb.com/">Bweeb, Inc.</a>. One of their related ventures, <a href="http://site5.com/">Site5 Web Hosting</a>, have been the primary advertiser on Downfor for the past few months, and they&#8217;ve been pleasant to work with. I don&#8217;t know quite what their plans for the site are. I also don&#8217;t have their permission to disclose the amount of the sale, but suffice to say that it was proportional to the amount of time and effort I&#8217;ve put into it (that is, not much).</p>
<p>And that, friends, is the story of an odd little single-purpose website with a silly domain name that, for some reason, thousands of people keep coming back to every day.</p>
<p><em>PS</em> The source for the site is <a href="https://github.com/al3x/downforeveryoneorjustme">open</a> once again.</p>
