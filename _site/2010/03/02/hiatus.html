<article class="post">
<h1>On Hiatus</h1>
<p>Over the past several years, this blog has gone from something that a few patient friends read to something with farther reach than I ever hoped or intended. This has been, alternately, flattering, infuriating, exhilarating, and terrifying.</p>
<p>I write for myself. Always have, always will. Writing helps me structure my ideas. I sit down to write when I&#8217;ve had something kicking around in my head that just won&#8217;t quit nagging at me. By the time I&#8217;m done, I can put that idea to rest and move on. Unfinished thoughts structured via writing yield catharsis. Ideally, this is how the process works for me.</p>
<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve found the cathartic returns from blog-format writing to be diminishing. The ideas I&#8217;m trying to express never really get put to rest in my head when I write, now. Instead, they spark whole conversations that I never intended to start in the first place, conversations that leech precious time and energy while contributing precious little back. Negative responses I can slough off, but the sense that I&#8217;m not really crystalizing my unset thoughts by writing here is what bothers me.</p>
<p>So. It&#8217;s time for me to take a break from blogging for a while.</p>
<h2>What Might Have Been</h2>
<p>This is a hard decision. Right now, I have a number of posts queued up:</p>
<ul>
	<li>One about how developer platforms are communities first and products second, and about how healthy platforms grow and mature organically.</li>
	<li>One about the creative possibilities of the iPad, as a sort of counterweight to my criticisms of the device&#8217;s closed design.</li>
	<li>One about how Objective-C has been successful despite being a fairly limited programming language, and what other language and <span class="caps">API</span> designers can learn from that unlikely success.</li>
	<li>One about the necessity of treating the creative process behind technology as if you were performing magic, and the worth of opening your mind to unorthodox methodologies and approaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I think about not publishing these things, I&#8217;m a little heartbroken. I enjoy sharing ideas, even when my ideas are shot down. I try to get better at communicating, at arguing, at persuading. But lately, I&#8217;ve been caught in a rut. I feel as if my writing isn&#8217;t really improving thanks to blogging, certainly not to the degree that bloggers I admire like <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> have improved in the time I&#8217;ve been reading them. I feel as if I stumble from one unintentionally inflammatory post to the next without gaining any particular insight.</p>
<p>A feedback loop of positive emails and tweets has kept me blogging despite my frustrations, but I find I&#8217;m no happier after I finish a post than when I started. If anything, blogging leaves me stressed out, disappointed, or just stuck with the sense that I&#8217;ve wasted my time. That&#8217;s why I need to take a public step back from writing here for a good long stretch.</p>
<h2>What May Yet Be</h2>
<p>I want to focus my creative energies outside of <a href="http://twitter.com/">work</a> on something more substantial than blogging. Co-authoring <a href="http://programmingscala.com/">Programming Scala</a> was deeply rewarding in a way that few other things in my life have ever been. I have another book project in the works, and I&#8217;d like to embark on that in the near future. It&#8217;s big project, though; daunting. I&#8217;ve been using blogging as a way of putting it off while still satisfying my itch to write.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been a lax open source citizen. My coworkers at Twitter are <a href="http://twitter.com/about/opensource">cranking out great open source code</a>. I&#8217;m not pulling my weight in this respect â€“ only one of those great projects on Twitter&#8217;s open source page has my avatar next to it. I have at least as many open source projects queued up as I do potential blog posts, and those projects may be a better illustration of how I view the craft of programming. Code can speak louder than words.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll still contribute to <a href="http://gracelessfailures.com/">Graceless Failures</a>, the group blog of Scala tips and tricks I started in 2008. I&#8217;ll probably write for the <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/">Twitter Engineering Blog</a> on occasion. I may yet find another outlet for my writing on programming, particularly as it pertains to the study of programming languages; a simple and frictionless format like Reg Braithwaite&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic">homoiconic</a> is appealing. In the past, I&#8217;ve found it useful to have a dedicated place to dive deep into a particular topic of interest. This particular blog has always been too &#8220;general interest&#8221; to get highly technical.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;ll be <a href="http://twitter.com/al3x">tweeting away</a>. Over time, I&#8217;m coming to realize what sort of messages I can communicate effectively via Twitter, and what sort I can&#8217;t. Twitter works least well for me when I try to cram big arguments down to 140 characters. Every medium has its particular sweet spot for a writer, and I&#8217;ve found that a combination of geeky humor, technical information-sharing, musical recommendations, and tidbits about my travels, drinking, and dining seem to make for the happiest followers on Twitter.</p>
<h2>The Next Few Months</h2>
<p>There are still friends who read this blog to hear about what&#8217;s going on in my life.</p>
<p>In about two weeks, I&#8217;m getting married to a sweet, funny, smart, beautiful woman that I met while living here in the Bay Area thanks to <a href="http://okcupid.com/">OkCupid</a>. When we started dating, marriage was the furthest thing from my mind. True love will sneak up on you. Let it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be wed at San Francisco City Hall on Friday, March 12th. That night, we&#8217;ll celebrate over cocktails at a local restaurant with our friends and family. A couple of days later we get on a plane for Saint Lucia, where we&#8217;ll spend a week in quiet paradise.</p>
<p>In May, my then-wife and I will be moving to Portland, Oregon, where I&#8217;ll continue to work for <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. Portland and the Pacific Northwest captured my heart and imagination in the time I&#8217;ve spent there, and I&#8217;m eager to get involved in the local community (tech and otherwise).</p>
<p>After all that, who knows. Maybe by later this year I&#8217;ll be ready to write here again. Maybe I&#8217;ll be in midst of researching my next book, too heads-down to come back to blogging. I&#8217;m not sure. But I thank you for having read this far, and I hope you&#8217;ll be generous enough with your time to read again, someday.</p>
