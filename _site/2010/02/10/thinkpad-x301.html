<article class="post">
<h1>Good Things: the Lenovo ThinkPad X301</h1>
<p>This is the first in a <a href="http://al3x.net/2010/02/08/good-things.html">series of posts</a> on good, nice things I&#8217;ve come across lately in the world of tech. I&#8217;m thinking of these posts as <em>curmudgeon offsets</em>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Late last year, I took a long multi-city trip to Australia. As always, I hauled along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro">mid-2009 fifteen-inch MacBook Pro</a> that <a href="http://twitter.com/jobs">work</a> provides for me, my sole machine for the past while. By the end of the trip, I was pretty burnt out on lugging around the 5.5 pound beast, and finally ready to violate one of my longstanding unwritten <a href="http://al3x.net/2008/09/08/al3xs-rules-for-computing-happiness.html">rules for computing happiness</a>: don&#8217;t try to maintain multiple computers. The prospect of having a lightweight machine, one completely divorced from my work machine and the responsibilities it entails, was deeply appealing.</p>
<h2>The Failed Dell Mini 10v Experiment</h2>
<p>My first attempt at a travel-friendly personal machine was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Inspiron_Mini_Series#Dell_Inspiron_Mini_10v">Dell Mini 10v</a>. I had seen recommendation after recommendation for this particular machine, apparently the little netbook that could. Friends boasted of their success with <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5389166/how-to-hackintosh-a-dell-mini-10v-into-the-ultimate-snow-leopard-netbook">hackintoshing</a> the machine to run Mac OS X, or how well it ran <a href="http://moblin.org/">various</a> <a href="http://www.canonical.com/projects/ubuntu/unr">netbook-optimized</a> <a href="http://www.jolicloud.com/">Linux distributions</a>.</p>
<p>I ordered my Mini 10v for a great price from the <a href="http://www.dell.com/outlet">Dell Outlet</a>, a painless process. Upgrading its memory was not so painless, but half an hour later I had what I hoped would be the perfect ultraportable. Unfortunately, simple ergonomics doomed my Mini 10v. The keyboard and touchpad were just undersized and awkwardly-located enough to make the machine all but unusable for me. I simply couldn&#8217;t use the thing for more than ten minutes without my hands cramping up and my eyes straining from the bitty screen.</p>
<p>So went the machine to a friend-of-a-friend bitten by the netbook bug. Plenty of people have made the Mini 10v work for them, and I hope it&#8217;s working out well for him.</p>
<h2>The MacBook Air</h2>
<p>In short order, I replaced the Mini 10v with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air">MacBook Air</a>. Having tried the cheaper &#8220;<span class="caps">DIY</span>&#8221; solution, the Air seemed like the obvious choice: pay a premium for a nice machine that Apple designed to be as travel-friendly as possible.</p>
<p>Reviews of the Air really are true: it&#8217;s an executive computer, for better and for worse. The Air shines when dashing out emails or documents on a cross-country flight. For anything much more intensive than that, it simply doesn&#8217;t cut it. The screen is a bit too dim and unevenly backlit for graphics work. The 2GB <span class="caps">RAM</span> limit makes memory-intensive software development tasks difficult. The paper-thin body leaves little room for fans, so the Air will overheat if, say, you have it resting on a comforter while trying to watch <a href="http://hulu.com/">Hulu</a> in bed.</p>
<p>Combine those issues with my increasing wariness of Apple&#8217;s politics, and after a couple of months I was left thinking that the Air just wasn&#8217;t the right fit for me. Politics aside, the rest of Apple&#8217;s portable lineup only gets heavier and bulkier after the Air. Even the 13&quot; MacBook Pro is 4.5 pounds, a heifer once you&#8217;re used the Air&#8217;s feather-light weight. Where else to look for a light but reasonably powerful machine that will run something other than Windows reliably? There are plenty of MacBook Air competitors out there, but how many of them are worth it?</p>
<h2>The ThinkPad X301</h2>
<p>A <a href="http://twitter.com/sroberts">friend</a> encouraged me to look once again at Lenovo&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad">ThinkPad</a> lineup. While Lenovo&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IdeaPad">IdeaPad</a> line is looking progressively and pleasantly more like MacBooks, they largely lack the power of their ThinkPad counterparts. Said friend loves his ThinkPad X200, but I can&#8217;t work comfortably on anything less than a 13&quot; display.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/notebooks/thinkpad/x-series/x301">ThinkPad X301</a>, Lenovo&#8217;s MacBook Air competitor. A bit pricey direct from the manufacturer, albeit comparable to the Air. I found one new on eBay for about $1400. The model I got lacks an optical drive, but then so did the Air; nothing lost there. It still has a 13&quot; screen, still has an <span class="caps">SSD</span>, still gets good (4-ish hours) battery life under real-world load, and adds in a built-in Verizon <span class="caps">WWAN</span> card.</p>
<p>In no way is the X301 as cleanly or elegantly designed as the MacBook Air. But that tradeoff has its advantages: the X301 has more ports, more choices for input (the usual TrackPoint &#8220;eraser&#8221; in addition to a multi-touch touchpad), and even a rather handy built-in light (I&#8217;m not a big fan of Apple&#8217;s light-up keyboards). The X301 also makes up for being slower in clock speed than the Air by taking twice as much <span class="caps">RAM</span>. The X301 feels faster than the Air even though it shouldn&#8217;t. This could be due to the extra <span class="caps">RAM</span>, or it could be a matter of the software/OS.</p>
<p>The screen isn&#8217;t appreciably better than the Air&#8217;s in terms of brightness, although it does look more consistent. The display isn&#8217;t in a widescreen layout, though I&#8217;ve found this to be preferable for some tasks. I&#8217;m enjoying the ThinkPad&#8217;s keyboard greatly, which has a wonderful tactility and finger-accommodating groove that Apple&#8217;s current generation of &#8220;chicklet&#8221; keyboards lack. Never having to worry about whether or not I can get on wi-fi or if I remembered a <span class="caps">WWAN</span> dongle/card is a joy as well. All that with just slightly more weight than an Air, still light enough that I can forget it&#8217;s on my shoulder.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m certainly not ready to say that I&#8217;ll never get another Mac portable. But for my particular set of needs/preferences in a travel-friendly laptop, the X301 seems ideal. It&#8217;s a nice thing to have a viable alternative to the hegemony of Apple laptops, one that doesn&#8217;t feel like a major compromise.</p>
<h2>Coming Up Next</h2>
<p>In my next post in this series, I&#8217;ll talk about the OS and the software I&#8217;m running on the X301, which has been a pleasant surprise.</p>
