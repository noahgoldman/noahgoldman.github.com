<h1>This <span class="caps">FOAF</span> Thing</h1>
<p>Nicholas Chase <a href="http://www.nicholaschase.com/blogger/2003_07_01_archive.html#105815043335179175">asks pointedly</a> of me, &#8220;[w]hat is this <span class="caps">FOAF</span> thing?&#8221;  I am not one to back down from an inquiry from Nicholas Chase, in part because I&#8217;m a wordy bastard who&#8217;ll use any excuse to write, and in part because I do not know Nicholas Chase at all, and he very well could do me bodily harm if I don&#8217;t answer his question.  So, threatened and uneasy, I reply, not just to the fearsome Mr. Chase but to any of my readers of varying technical aptitude and interest who may wonder what the hell I&#8217;m on about.<br />
<a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"><span class="caps">FOAF</span></a>, which stands for Friend Of A Friend, is in technical terms a Resource Description Framework (<a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"><span class="caps">RDF</span></a>) namespace, or vocabulary, for describing people and their relationships to other people.  Like all <span class="caps">RDF</span> data, <span class="caps">FOAF</span> data is exchanged in <span class="caps">XML</span>, an arbitrary markup language (think <span class="caps">HTML</span>, only you can essentially make up tags for types of information you deem important).  <span class="caps">FOAF</span> is still in its formative stages, but already is exceptionally usable for its intended purpose (see below).  I personally find it far more &#8220;readable&#8221; than other <span class="caps">RDF</span> vocabularies, as much as any structured data schema intended for automation can be readable.</p>
<p>Those are the very basics, and the <span class="caps">FOAF</span> link above in turn links to a plethora of useful information about the namespace.  What&#8217;s more interesting is FOAF&#8217;s use, and to illustrate that I employ a metaphor.  <span class="caps">FOAF</span> data (a <span class="caps">FOAF</span> file, for argument&#8217;s sake) is like a business card, but rather than displaying exclusively your personal information (name, phone number, address, web site, etc.) it references a number of designated friends  as well.  This reference is not <em>all</em> available information about your friends, but merely a means to get their business card, and in turn the associated information and references to <em>their</em> friends.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take much further pondering to realize that a few of these &#8220;hyper business cards&#8221; in your possession would put social connections with a large group of people at your fingertips, much like this Friendster I&#8217;ve been yakking about.  While <span class="caps">FOAF</span> as means for exploring social networks may not be as easy to use as a closed and centralized system like Friendster, the fact that it&#8217;s open, public, and above all <em>just a data format</em> means that developers can build it into all kinds of applications, and users in turn can exploit its advantages in all kinds of ways.  Indeed, in the process of planning <a href="http://sexxi.al3x.net/&#39;s">Sexxi</a> architecture we searched for a data format that would easily allow us to &#8220;spider&#8221; through the list of web publications that a user reads,then the list of publications the authors of <em>those</em> publications read, and so forth, looking for relevant data.  <span class="caps">FOAF</span> is clearly the best format for this task, and its all the more appealing now that Six Apart&#8217;s <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> hosted blogging service will automatically generate <span class="caps">FOAF</span> files for all its users.  I expect <span class="caps">FOAF</span> to become, much like my metaphor, a sort of business card in online communities, informing others not just who you are and how to contact you, but who you know and/or read.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of potential in <span class="caps">FOAF</span>, and a lot of application to Sexxi, so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m on about it so much.  I hope that explanation was satisfactory.  Don&#8217;t hurt me, Nicholas Chase.  I do not wish to know the destructive power of this &#8220;<a href="http://www.nicholaschase.com/blogger/weblog.html">chaos magnet</a>&#8221; you claim to wield.</p>
