<article class="post">
<h1>Security, Community, And Me</h1>
<p>News.com has an <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1009_3-5057566.html">article</a> on pretty much what I was talking about yesterday: the problems of disclosing – and not disclosing – security vulnerabilities.  And to clarify, if there&#8217;s one thing the anti-sec hacking groups like el8 got the security community to <a href="http://www.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Firewall-Wizards/2002-08/0404.html">consider</a> it was the possibility that <em>no</em> exploit code would leave black hat hands, leaving manufacturers and InfoSec pros alike in the dark.  The News.com article suggests that while that&#8217;s not quite the case a year after the White Hat Hate/Project Mayhem hoopla of last summer, roughly 90% of all exploits are kept &#8220;private&#8221; by black hats.</p>
<p>I always seem to get back into security around this time of summer.  Maybe it&#8217;s the buzz around conventions like <a href="http://www.defcon.org/">DefCon</a>, which I&#8217;ve never gotten a chance to get to, and maybe it&#8217;s the direction my summer work always seems to take me – or I take it.  But security, and the security community, are an endless source of fascination to me.</p>
<p>When I was younger, and known about my school for going to &#8220;hacker meetings&#8221; (really just my humble <a href="http://www.dc2600.com">local 2600 meeting</a>, a motley crew if ever there was one), students and teachers alike would ask me in hushed tones &#8220;what are those people really like?&#8221;  I hardly consider myself an insider, but I&#8217;ve met some infamous folks and spent all to much time with &#8220;everyhackers,&#8221; the average Janes and Joes of the security community.  I can say that they are at once intriguing and appalling, inspiring and frustrating.  You know, just like most people.<br />
Everyone in the community has something to prove: underground kids who can spend their days coding exploits &#8216;cause they live in the parent&#8217;s basement and can pass their classes without batting an eye, throwing up their prowess to their professional elders; the pros themselves, now perpetually on the defensive; the rare female hackers, lording their sexuality over awkward geek boys; and the arrested development cases that are the male majority of the hacker world, ultra-competitive in this one turf they can comfortably claim.</p>
<p>The (tamer) conventions I&#8217;ve been to are a frenzy of attitude, in-jokes and cliques, hittings-on, drinking, drugs, and everything else you&#8217;d expect from a self-styled underground.  And yet, there&#8217;s a certain harmlessness to it all when you realize that these are the people who never got invited to the high school parties finally getting a chance to cut loose amongst their own.  Of course, I&#8217;m over-generalizing.  I&#8217;ve met enough hackers who have an idiomatic distinctiveness to them, who can at once be a part of the community and observe it cooly, and often with a sense of humor.  But most get swept up in it all, and it&#8217;s easy to have that happen.  Enjoyable, even.</p>
<p>So why do I write about all this from a detached vantage point if I have a certain affection for the hacker community?  Because for one, my involvement and interest in it has waxed and waned, though I&#8217;ve assumed for a number of years that my professional life would inevitably involve InfoSec matters.  And secondly, because there is a crassness to the community that I find gauche at its least and downright ugly at its worst.  I&#8217;ve yet to make the pilgrimage to DefCon because the prospect of hundreds of hackers salivating over strippers and whores, addled on watered-down drinks and fired up from self-serving debates on the conference floor has a kind of information-age-Hunter S. Thompson ghastliness to it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also not what I would call a real hacker.  I can&#8217;t (at least not often) look at code and tell you where it&#8217;s exploitable.  I can&#8217;t look at long strings of hexadecimal and translate it in my head in less than five minutes.  Perhaps those aren&#8217;t the best examples, but what I mean to say is that I just don&#8217;t have that preternatural instinct for computation that makes math geniuses, grand masters in chess, and great hackers.  Which is not to say I don&#8217;t have my strengths in the field, but just that I don&#8217;t measure up to the criteria of a truly brilliant hacker – then again, few do.  My gift – and my true interest – is having a combination of technical understanding, social and political instinct, and a general ability to synthesize, in the rhetorical sense, the varied disciplines that converge around Information Security.  I may not be picking exploits out of djb&#8217;s code, but damned if I don&#8217;t have aspirations to write policy that would please hackers and Feds alike.  You could call me a hacker of policy.  Or the gangster of love, that&#8217;d be fine too.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my love-hate relationship with the security world, naive as it must seem not even being a professional in the field.  But it&#8217;s a unique sport, one in which amateurs shape the game, pros struggle to keep up, and the refs don&#8217;t know what the fuck is going on.  Why I insist on taking it up again and again in the heat of summer is just as puzzling to me as the sport itself.</p>
