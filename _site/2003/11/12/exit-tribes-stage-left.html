<h1>Exit Tribes, Stage Left?</h1>
<p>I was quite big on <a href="http://www.tribes.net/">Tribes.net</a> when I first found out about it, elated at a &#8220;Friendster without the suck&#8221; (which <em>should</em> be the Tribes slogan).  Even with the hot new Fleshbot <a href="http://www.fleshbot.com/archives/010072.php">singing its (erotic) praises</a> I can&#8217;t shake the urge to get up and split from it.  What changed?</p>
<p>Well, maybe it&#8217;s what didn&#8217;t.  Or what doesn&#8217;t.  Community sites, of the hip social networking variety or otherwise, have a coolness carrying capacity (<span class="caps">CCC</span>).  Once the <span class="caps">CCC</span> is exceeded for a forum, mailing list, <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel, group weblog, or a site like Tribes the usefulness and entertainment value of the community both make a halo jump race for zero.  The problem is, it&#8217;s not that these communities are attracting the <em>wrong</em> people, it&#8217;s just that they&#8217;re attracting people at all.  The larger the group of people, the more stupid/useless/annoying people present.  Simple as that.  Good communities become victims of their own quality.  And oh yeah: the good communities aren&#8217;t the elite moderated ones.  There&#8217;s no way around the <span class="caps">CCC</span>.</p>
<p>Tribes breached the <span class="caps">CCC</span> sometime in late September.  When I signed on it already had a very Left Coast vibe (lots of Burning Man-heads, tribes repping San Francisco, that sort of crap), but at least it wasn&#8217;t the total deadbeat/sleazemonger/idiot/whore refuge that Friendster is.  That&#8217;s started to change as the Fleshbot linkage above demonstrates.  I&#8217;m as frisky as the next cat, to be sure, but robot sex fetish discussion groups betray at least terminal goofiness in a community.  And that&#8217;s fine for most people, so that sort of fluff increases exponentially as more people join in.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m a social networking misanthrope or something.  At the very least I&#8217;ve had no success trying to use Tribes for one its major intended purposes: as a &#8220;trusted&#8221; classified ads system, <a href="http://www.craigslist.com-cum-Friendster">Craigslist</a>.  Wasn&#8217;t able to find a server rack, someone to go out to a jungle/drum-n-bass night with in all of DC/MD/VA, and now not much luck trying to sell my iBook.  Since Tribes is pretty much just the classifieds and  awkward, limited message boards, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s not doing a brilliant job.  Maybe I&#8217;d have more luck if I was in San Francisco.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll stick around for another week or so, see if anything interesting happens.  I&#8217;ve been invited to join a lot of Tribes, and have had some interesting people spontaneously request to be in my circle of friends.  I like the recipe tribe.  But it&#8217;s by and large not worth my time to go out and check up on my Tribes anymore.  Pity.  Social networking would be great if it wasn&#8217;t for people.</p>
