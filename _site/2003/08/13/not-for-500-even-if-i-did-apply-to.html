<h1>Not for $500, Even If I Did Apply To Speak</h1>
<p>I like me some blogging.  I don&#8217;t mind having a conversation every now again about blogging, blog software, and so forth.  I had a great time a couple months back meeting local and international bloggers and talking to some of the Moveable Type crew.  But the idea of a our-own-horn-tootin&#8217; <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/">conference</a> on blogging is pretty obnoxious.  Fittingly enough, it&#8217;s been <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/32315.html">slammed</a> by amusingly obnoxious Register reporter Andrew Orlowski, and the conference itself is organized by the purportedly most obnoxious man in the blogosphere, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>.<br />
Full disclosure: when Winer put out an open call for speakers for said conference, before it was apparent that even speakers would have to cough up $500 for this weekend o&#8217; bullcrap, I half-seriously talked myself up to him as a potential speaker on the Technology panel.  What Winer <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/stories/storyReader$55">requested</a>, what got me thinking, was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want &#8220;how I did this last summer&#8221; narratives, I want sweeping conclusions, &#8220;the industry is failing at this,&#8221; or &#8220;users would pay for this, but no one is supplying it.&#8221; Or whatever it is that users have to say about the state of the technology. I want opinionated big-thinkers, who happen not to be vendors.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8230;and, still pretty buzzed on the Supernova blog dinner, I thought, &#8220;I can do that, and Harvard would be a nice weekend trip.&#8221;  So I wrote Winer on a whim.  But now that the rest of the gory financial details on BloggerCon have come out I&#8217;m pretty glad I never heard back from him.  It would have been neat for BloggerCon to be contrarian in tone, to be the weblog conference that says &#8220;weblogs are just a tool, get on with it.&#8221;  I would&#8217;ve liked to say that, but if the Register article has one clear conclusion it&#8217;s that most (good) bloggers already feel that way.  Better left unrepeated, and certainly not worth $500 for the chance.</p>
