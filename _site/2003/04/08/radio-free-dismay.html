<h1>Radio Free Dismay</h1>
<p>The mix went quite well, but hardly anyone was listening.  Three people tuned in for the later few minutes on UMBC&#8217;s &#8220;mid-fi&#8221; MP3 stream (the hi-fi stream being perpetually broken, like most of the radio station&#8217;s equipment and space).  I put quite a bit of time, even money if you count hardware, into the show, and I feel like I&#8217;m getting very little out of it.  The people running our campus radio station, <span class="caps">WMBC</span>, are all talk when it comes to getting more exposure for the station.  I&#8217;d do that work myself, but as it is the time I spend preparing my sets is time I should be working on school stuff.</p>
<p>So hardly anyone knows about the station, much less my show, and that&#8217;s not great.  But it&#8217;s been since last semester that I had anyone say that they were introduced to music they found interesting by my show, and that&#8217;s what bugs me more than anything.  I think, as far as generating exposure for the artists I like, I&#8217;d be better off doing mixes and announcing/releasing them over this site.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</strong> and that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;ve decided to do.  No more radio show, barring <span class="caps">WMBC</span> getting their collective shit together, and expect bimonthly mixes released here in MP3, probably encoded at 96 to keep the file size (and thus my bandwidth expenses) down.   I may, in fact, attempt to replicate the rather good mix I did tonight for starters.  Thoughts on this decision are appreciated.</p>
