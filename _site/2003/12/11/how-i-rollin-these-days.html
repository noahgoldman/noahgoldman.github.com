<h1>How I&#8217;m Rollin&#8217; These Days</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve moved home.  Not just for the winter break, but quite possibly for the rest of my college education.</p>
<p>As I posted a few days back, the whole college thing hasn&#8217;t been brilliant, particularly socially.  I spend a lot of my time driving back from my present school, <span class="caps">UMBC</span> (near Baltimore, as per its name), to be back in DC.  I&#8217;ve come to connect with DC in a way I haven&#8217;t connected with any other American city, and as long as I&#8217;m in this country it&#8217;s hard to imagine being anywhere else.  I don&#8217;t have many friends, but they&#8217;re here, for now.  It&#8217;s where I feel comfortable.  I&#8217;d launch into a long exultation of the virtues of DC but&#8230;  some other time.</p>
<p>So my parents, having noticed how much time I spend driving back &#8220;home&#8221; to the city, rather generously suggested that I move back to their place in Bethesda (which, for those of you unfamiliar with the DC area, is a neighborhood in bordering Maryland quite close to the District).  For the next semester, during which I&#8217;ll almost certainly continue at <span class="caps">UMBC</span>, I&#8217;ll commute to school like the (percieved) majority of students there.  And I&#8217;m applying to <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/"><span class="caps">GWU</span></a> for the Fall of my junior year, that campus is wonderfully smack-dab in DC and possessing of their <a href="http://www.cpi.seas.gwu.edu/">Cyber Security Policy and Research Institute</a>.  Of course, should I not get in to <span class="caps">GWU</span> and have to remain at <span class="caps">UMBC</span>, that would be just fine too.</p>
<p>The question I&#8217;ve gotten quite a bit from friends is, predictably: &#8220;wow, you could move back in with your parents?!&#8221;  Yeah, I could, and quite happily.  I&#8217;m incredibly close to my mother and stepfather, and the arrangement of space in the house allows me to come and go as I please without disturbing anyone else.  It is odd, I admit, being a young man who considers himself pretty mature and urban  to be now living at home in the suburbs (though city-adjacent and quite lovely suburbs they are).  But it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve given up a lot of freedom or city culture by leaving my residence on the <span class="caps">UMBC</span> campus: with no social scene there, only somewhat close proximity to the cultural near-wasteland that is Baltimore, and the summer camp vibe of my former apartment-cum-dormitory I certainly don&#8217;t feel like I was an independent young adult just starting to make my way in the world.  And, that aside, I wasn&#8217;t having any goddamn fun living on campus, which is what it comes down to.</p>
<p>I get to be back near my city.  With classes a mere four days a week this coming Spring semester (Monday through Thursday) I can take the repeated advice I&#8217;ve gotten and &#8220;treat school like a job, get in and get out,&#8221; and indeed get out to the place I love the remainder of the time.  I get to listen to <span class="caps">NPR</span> and sing to myself in my car during the commute.  I think it&#8217;s a pretty good deal.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&#8217;t work out I&#8217;ll go live with Scott.  Or go be G&#8217;s private chef, as she keeps offering.  Yeah.  Either one of those would work out great.</p>
