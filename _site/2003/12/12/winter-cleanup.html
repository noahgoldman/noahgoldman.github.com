<article class="post">
<h1>Winter Cleanup</h1>
<p>A bunch of circumstances colluded to motivate me into making some changes on this site I&#8217;ve been meaning to get to for a while.</p>
<p>Firstly, under the &#8220;Social Context&#8221; links provided to the right, you&#8217;ll notice that the links to my <span class="caps">FOAF</span> file and <a href="http://www.blogshares.com/">Blogshares</a> are gone.  I axed my <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"><span class="caps">FOAF</span></a> because nobody was using it according to my server statistics and because <span class="caps">FOAF</span>, like so many <span class="caps">RDF</span>/semantic web initiatives thusfar, is an awkward pain-in-the-ass way of conveying information that doesn&#8217;t yet have either a usable interface or clear purpose (and this coming from someone about to embark on a very <span class="caps">FOAF</span>-centric project this past summer. Diss!).  The Blogshares link is gone because Blogshares has, in the last week or so, closed, reopened, changed hands, and is in a general state of flux.  Blogshares was also boring about a week after it started.  <a href="http://www.jerkcity.com/jerkcity1896.html">Unlike the Jerkcity boys</a> I&#8217;m not suicidal over its passing.  <em>Yawn</em>.</p>
<p>Secondly, I&#8217;ve re-written my <a href="http://www.al3x.net/about.html">&#8220;About&#8221;</a> page to be a bare-facts list of things about me.  Anything you&#8217;d like to see added I&#8217;ll happily consider, but the goofy narrative that was there before had to go.</p>
<p>Lastly, and still in the same vein of goofy narratives, I&#8217;m taking Betsy Devine&#8217;s <a href="http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/2003/12/09#a878">advice</a> about some of my personal posts.  She says, wisely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t blog your drinking habits, pet peeves, relationship issues, etc. in a personal blog that&#8217;s on the first page of Google when [a potential employer] types in your name [&#8230;] limit yourself to corporate/geeky stuff on any page linked to from Google results for your name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sage advice.  A Google for &#8220;Alexander Payne&#8221; usually offers this site, or a recent post from this site, on the first page of results.  At times I&#8217;ve been blogging near-daily I&#8217;ve actually beaten out the director with whom I share a name.  Do I really want potential employers and strangers knowing about my breakups and such?  Nope, not really; I usually regret posting that sort of thing even for my friends.  So I&#8217;ve cleared a few things out the &#8220;Personal&#8221; category archive.  I was hesitant about deleting a couple of those posts for fear of losing the supportive, insightful, and pleasant comments attached to them.  But, for the same reason I hardly keep any pictures, I&#8217;m comfortable keeping those comments and memories to myself.</p>
<p>It does feel a little dishonest to have deleted these things I&#8217;ve shared with anyone and everyone, like I&#8217;m re-editing history (now I know how the Bush administration feels!  <em>ba-zing!</em>).  But, just as I remember writing those posts, so too do any friends and regular readers remember reading them.  I&#8217;ll exercise a little more discretion in the personal matters I post here in the future; things like my move home I see as apropos, an update for my far-flung friends and well-wishers.  Relationship issues and the like, well: this isn&#8217;t a LiveJournal.  It&#8217;s fine to write those things, no doubt, but this just isn&#8217;t the space for it.</p>
<p>I considered seeking out such a space, slightly more personal and dissociated from this &#8220;professional&#8221; online identity (<em>cough</em>) , but I just can&#8217;t see that being useful.  If anything, barring myself from posting personal issues here should get me back to writing more interesting and critical material, something I feel like I&#8217;ve been away from for a long time.  It may be cathartic to write about my personal life, but it&#8217;s rarely writing I&#8217;m happy with or proud of in hindsight.  And that pretty much settles the matter for me.</p>
<p>So there you go: couple little things, couple big things.  Now back to your regularly unscheduled blog.</p>
