<h1>Synchronicity</h1>
<p>Patterns emerge.  You just notice them more when you look.</p>
<p>I set out for last night with the unconscious goal of having an experience that would validate moving back near DC.  My known goal and intent was to see <a href="http://www.rjyan.com/">Cex</a> at the Warehouse Next Door, an intimate space perfect for such a conversational and emotional performer.  <a href="http://www.timeporn.net/">Phil</a> and girlfriend L were supposed to join <a href="http://www.5dots.net/">Craig</a> and I, but after an evening of gallery management L was is no mood for a show and she and Phil stayed home.  Having gone back-and-forth from the city to Bethesda several times that day already, I once again drove down Massachusetts Avenue, my favorite inroad to the District.  I didn&#8217;t mind driving it again.</p>
<p>Before the show I finally met a friend of Craig&#8217;s, <a href="http://www.variate.net/">Joe</a>, who is working on the album art for Craig&#8217;s first album, the first release from our label <a href="http://www.adjectiverecords.com/">Adjective Records</a>.  Amongst other topics of conversation Joe brought up synchronicity; his day had been filled with minor coincidences and reoccurring patterns.  He joked that he was kin to Case, dear-to-me author <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/&#39;s">William Gibson</a> tragic hacker hero chemically gifted with an meta-attuned third eye, able to find connections in vast seas of data.  Like, I imagine, many dorks, I&#8217;ve read myself into Case more than once.  Joe&#8217;s reference stuck with me.</p>
<p>Cex played a set dominated by a long, dreamy aural mixture of his trademark simple and emotive acoustic guitar balanced by swirling ambience and snippets of casually recorded conversation, audio perhaps clipped from of a group of friends&#8217; camcorder&#8217;d afternoon out.  The combination bled forth Cex&#8217;s frequent musical themes of both longing-for and dissociation-from familiar friends and places, a sad but hopeful smile laid on the ears.  He sang just a little, his lyrics and delivery honest as ever.  Progressively more of the small audience sat down on the venue&#8217;s floor during the show, like a sleepy kindergarten class happily being read to.  It was the best show I&#8217;ve seen in some time, and the evening happily could have ended there.</p>
<p>But Craig and I, though lacking Phil&#8217;s company, made a near-obligatory trek to Oasis, a perpetually open hookah bar and Middle Eastern cafe located amongst a strip of ethnic shops and businesses in Northern Virginia.  I&#8217;ve written on the merits of hookahs before but the culinary pleasure of banana shisha is worth repeating myself for.  No sooner had we sat down then I recognized an acquaintance from a couple months back: <a href="http://www.metacoretex.com/">Visigoth</a>, a gifted hacker and general nice guy, who was pleasant enough to invite us over to the table he was sharing with his friends.</p>
<p>Visigoth and company were deeply involved in a game of <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kory/Games/Zendo/">Zendo</a>, a game with rules so simple and potential outcomes so complex that Steven Wolfram would need to change his shorts after a round.  It&#8217;s a game of inductive logic, or as Visigoth put it, &#8220;pattern recognition.&#8221;  More Gibson.  More synchronicity, literally laid out in game form on a table before us.  We smoked and played into the late hours.</p>
<p>And when I drove Craig home it was snowing, endless flakes the same from a normal mind&#8217;s-eye distance, all different when viewed closely.  And it was better than good to be home again.</p>
