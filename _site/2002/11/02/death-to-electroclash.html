<h1>Death to Electroclash</h1>
<p>I really, really, <em>really</em> hate the musical <a href="http://www.quinion.com/words/turnsofphrase/tp-ele4.htm/">genre</a> &#8211;  <a href="http://www.trendcentral.com/trends/trendarticle.asp?tcArticleId=200/">movement</a> &#8211; <a href="http://www.cerealrobots.com/photog/2002/oct/electroclash/index.htm">lifestyle</a> that is Electroclash.  Ergo, I was amused by this <a href="http://www.phinnweb.com/313ctr0/electroclash/index2.html">how to be Electroclash</a> guide, presented in an appropriately tongue-in-cheek tone by someone who <a href="http://www.phinnweb.com/313ctr0/index2.html">genuinely</a> seems like to like <em>real</em> electro.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m generally not one to undermine people&#8217;s taste in music.  I may poke fun at mainstream R&amp;B and bad no-longer-alternative rock, but it&#8217;s my strongly held belief that &#8220;whatever gets you moving&#8221; is valid; as a DJ, you pretty much have to have a musical mind open enough to fit a big record collection into.  But there&#8217;s something about Electroclash that makes me cringe.  Perhaps because it&#8217;s Generation X&#8217;s latest fad, and I do so loathe that whole age group – disaffected, self-consciously ironic, and desperately clinging onto relics of their youth.  Maybe it&#8217;s because I quite enjoy the two genres that were blended and butchered to form Electroclash – 1980s synth-pop (Human League, Gary Numan, etc.) and &#8220;ghetto electro,&#8221; an odd and short-lived branch of hip-hop that took the sounds of the then-emerging techno scene and folded them back into a rootsy, booty-shaking style that had as much to do with the bouncing drums of hip-hop as it did with the booming, spacey bass of Jamaican dub.</p>
<p>These are two fine genres, but both with limitations that forced them out of style relatively quickly.  There have been some good reinterpretations of ghetto electro pre-Electroclash, most notably by English DJ <a href="http://www.theprimalscream.com/andreaparker/">Andrea Parker</a>, and of course periodic waves of interest in the whole &#8217;80s sound, kept largely to bad <a href="http://www.cleorecs.com/">Cleopatra Records</a> compilation albums or mediocre New Order covers by the hard rock flavor of the month.  But Electroclash drags out these well-aged sounds, now comfortably rocking away in the Sunnydale Home for Golden Genres, and forces them to have a night on the town in sequins, headbands, and entirely too much makeup.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://www.xlr8r.com">XLR8R magazine</a> editorial suggested the painfully obvious racism of Electroclash (look at the average e-clash club night crowd) with a quote from genre &#8220;impresario&#8221; Larry Tee: &#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been a voice for disaffected white youth since grunge.&#8221;  Christ.  XLR8R says: &#8220;here&#8217;s another shovel, dumbass,&#8221; and I couldn&#8217;t agree more.  Perhaps there hasn&#8217;t been a &#8220;voice&#8221; for Gen-Xers  in some time because no one wants to hear what they have to say.  And if they weren&#8217;t the current generation running the entertainment media, we wouldn&#8217;t be hearing about Electroclash at all.  Why publicize a trend that embraces the ugliest values of the already deplorable 1980s, turns some of its best musical output into self-conscious, generic drivel, and does it all with a sickeningly ironic flair, teasing us to decide how seriously the genre even takes itself?</p>
<p>Thank god people seem to be rediscovering <a href="http://www.dub.com">dub</a> in its intended positive spirit and not bastardizing an urban lifestyle out of it.  &#8216;Cause then I&#8217;d <em>really</em> get mad&#8230;</p>
