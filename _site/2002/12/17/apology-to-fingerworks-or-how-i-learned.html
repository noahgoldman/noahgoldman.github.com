<h1>An Apology to FingerWorks (or how I learned to love the keyless keyboard)</h1>
<p>I was smitten with <a href="http://www.fingerworks.com">FingerWorks&#8217;</a> TouchStream technology when I first<br />
read about it on that repository (suppository?) of all things geek, Slashdot. It&#8217;s a brilliant idea:<br />
take a touchpad, make it super-duper smart with gesture support, map a keybord to it, and slap the<br />
whole thing on an ergonomic frame. You get a device that lets you mouse, gesture with your<br />
fingertips for damn near every keyboard shortcut you can think of, and then go right to typing<br />
without moving your hands. It did wonders for my crippling hands, and the mousing and gestures were<br />
very intuitive.</p>
<p>Typing was another story. I stumbled around the keyboard for several weeks, finally calling<br />
FingerWorks with thoughts of returning the ST. I was told that one needed about five weeks to really<br />
get comfortable with the key layout, so I gave it time (time past the 30 day limit on returns,<br />
something of a leap of faith). Sure enough, I got comfortable with the layout, and my fingers<br />
memorized where to go for what. But then, a problem: once I was able to type quickly, the text<br />
completion firmware in the keyboard had a hard time keeping up with me. With the keys being<br />
essentially &#8220;virtual,&#8221; software handles the process of figuring out what the hell you&#8217;re trying to<br />
type and makes guesses; it doesn&#8217;t always guess right, however, and I found that frustrating.</p>
<p>Once again, I contacted FingerWorks, and was basically told to type somewhat slowly and carefully,<br />
particularly when typing non-English words (like geekisms). In a huff over my lost words per minute,<br />
I shipped the ST back and went to re-explore the world of mechanical keyboards and mice.</p>
<p>I found a miserable, finger-twisting world. I like the keyboard built into my iBook well enough, and<br />
its accompanying trackpad isn&#8217;t half bad either. But trying to find a decent mechanical keyboard<br />
that&#8217;ll fit into my rather cramped dorm desk keyboard tray, and then an ergonomic mouse to match,<br />
proved basically impossible. I tried a MacAlly iceKey, whose laptop-like keys make for fast input<br />
but no wrist support. I tried an Adesso Tru-Form with a built-in touchpad so awkwardly placed that<br />
it nullified the benefits of the keyboard&#8217;s otherwise ergonomic layout. In the mouse department, I<br />
tried a Kensington Studio Mouse, which was simply too dainty for my big hands, though very stylish.<br />
All in all, I was left longing for my TouchStream ST. So I called FingerWorks again, and it&#8217;s on its<br />
way back to me.</p>
<p>Ultimately, sacrificing a few extra words per minute of typing speed for improved ergonomics and<br />
gesture support is entirely worthwhile. My knuckles have locked up again, being away from the<br />
TouchStream for almost five days. With that in mind, my apologies to FingerWorks, makers of the best<br />
damn computer input device around. I&#8217;m a tough customer, but the ST&#8217;s price warrants some second<br />
thoughts. It&#8217;s worth it, though. Boy, is it ever worth it <em>cracks knuckles</em>.&quot;</p>
