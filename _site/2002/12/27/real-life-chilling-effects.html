<h1>Real Life Chilling Effects</h1>
<p>My family went over to the palatial Virginia home of some of our friends, an extensive clan headed<br />
by an old friend of my stepfather who happens to run a large computer company. After good food and a<br />
chance to play with a stylish but otherwise astoundingly mediocre Compaq tablet PC, we got to<br />
chatting. One of the daughters in this family is going to school in Scotland, and studying the<br />
biosciences. When asked by my mother if she intended to move abroad after school, she quickly<br />
confirmed this. Not only does she (understandably) like the people and atmosphere in the UK, but<br />
<em>she&#8217;s interested in stem-cell research, which she probably won&#8217;t be able to do here in the US</em>.</p>
<p>This just about ruined my evening right there. Here&#8217;s an incredibly smart, American<br />
born/raised/educated young woman interested in life saving sciences that she <em>won&#8217;t be able to<br />
pursue in our country</em>. We&#8217;re losing her, many of her student peers and their professional<br />
superiors, the money and immediate medicinal benefits their research could bring, and our position as leaders in the world technology and medicine markets. And what for?</p>
<p>The ethical insecurities of Congressmen, Senators, and lobbyists who call themselves Christians<br />
while redirecting funds for social services and public health to weapons and missile defense? Our<br />
political leaders are making our decisions clouded in a veil of technological <i>and</i> ethical<br />
ignorance; they have demonstrated little understanding in either realm. But a decision that appeals<br />
to the self-appointed &#8220;faithful&#8221; in this country can gather Bible Belt support in numbers large<br />
enough to sway a reelection vote. Good Christian values have nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re losing this talented young woman, and countless like her. We&#8217;re just plain losing, as a nation<br />
previously concerned with progress. These are the <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/">Chilling Effects</a><br />
of technologically impaired legislation, and winter is just beginning&#8230;</p>
