<article class="post">
<h1>Castaway</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s always nice to see the (not so) new new thing <a href="http://www.podcastingnews.com/archives/2005/06/david_coursey_p.html">disparaged</a>.  Appeals to the inner curmudgeon almost as much as <a href="http://www.idlewords.com/audio-manifesto.txt">Maciej&#8217;s audioblogging manifesto</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t particularly enjoy podcasts, which strikes even me as odd given that I&#8217;m the technology&#8217;s &#8220;target demographic&#8221; if ever there was one: a rabid <span class="caps">RSS</span> consumer, music fan, and habitual early adopter of social technologies.  I gave some of the earliest podcasts their due back when they first got buzz and I&#8217;ve since revisited the medium regularly, hoping for improvements.  I don&#8217;t think David Coursey&#8217;s dismissal is anything more than his gut instinct, but I also don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s wrong about podcasting being a &#8220;loser&#8221; as media distribution technologies go.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see any inherent worth in the produce of &#8220;remix culture.&#8221;  Just because a work is distributed via a medium like podcasting that&#8217;s touted as &#8220;empowering media consumers&#8221; or &#8220;making us all content creators&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make that work engaging or valuable.  The best of remix culture rises to the top and breaks away; the best mashup artists have found distribution with solid labels, for example.</p>
<p>The flipside of this is that podcasting is not exclusively an amateur technology.  Far from it, podcasting was so quickly scouted and co-opted for its &#8220;viral marketing potential&#8221; that it never had time to be a genuine grassroots phenomenon.  Major media outlets, keeping desperate watch on the social technology sphere so as not to miss another <span class="caps">RSS</span> or Friendster, jumped on podcasting like a presidential sex scandal.  Mainstream content producers perked up and got on the bandwagon.  Now there&#8217;s a mix of commercial and amateur content available via podcast, and that&#8217;s that.</p>
<p>So why doesn&#8217;t it <em>feel</em> right, like real radio?  Why aren&#8217;t I listening to <em>This American Life</em> as produced by some kid in an apartment in Chicago, rather than out of Chicago Public Radio?</p>
<p>Podcasting is an awkward technology, stemming from its <span class="caps">RSS</span> roots.  Lots of my non-techie friends are now using an <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader daily, and while it&#8217;s not a difficult concept to explain, it just doesn&#8217;t click until you try it.  When extended to podcasts, there are dozens of different &#8220;podcatchers&#8221; and half-assed implementations in existing feed readers.  Integration into iTunes should help ease this confusion, but people will gripe about newcomers to podcasting missing out on shows that aren&#8217;t featured in Apple&#8217;s directory.</p>
<p>Awkward technolgies require a certain personality type to overcome the minor obstacles they pose.  Much like the first wave of webloggers, the first wave of podcasters are people eager and willing to beta-test a whole new way of distributing content.  This probably explains their penchant for talking about podcasting itself more than anything else.  Bloggers got dissed for too much &#8220;metablogging,&#8221; and even then you didn&#8217;t actually have to hear their voices in unskimmable realtime.</p>
<p>With blogs, podcasts, all of it, I feel like we&#8217;re all beta-testing a new media that doesn&#8217;t yet hold its own.  I think we&#8217;ll know we&#8217;ve got it right when people stop talking about producing content and just produce content.  We need more beautiful things to hear and see and read, not a generation of amateur media theorists with big microphones.  In my perfect world I&#8217;d never have been compelled to write this post, is what I&#8217;m saying.</p>
<p>Oh.  Crap.</p>
