<h1>Three Mac Pieces, #1: The iPod Story</h1>
<p>I used to have a bad habit of acquiring and selling gear constantly.  My gadget portfolio was ever-rotating, though through deft eBaying I never managed to come out more than $20-30 behind when swapping one toy for another.  Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a habit I decided to break a year ago.  I&#8217;ve had the same laptop, the same phone, and the same iPod since.  Though I knew the bulky 40GB clickwheel iPod didn&#8217;t make as much sense for ambling around San Francisco as an iPod shuffle, I decided to wait until it bit the dust to replace it, just to stick to my resolution.</p>
<p>The planned obsolescence gods heard me, I guess.  Shortly after moving, my iPod went on the fritz, doing all kinds of weird disk stuff.  I reflashed the firmware, did all the diagnostics the Genius Bar would do, and finally broke down and went over to the big Apple store downtown.</p>
<p>Genius: &#8220;Well, we can replace it for a $30 processing fee, or you can buy Apple Care for $60 and that&#8217;ll get you a replacement and and an extended warranty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Me: &#8220;Uh.  I don&#8217;t really want a new clickwheel iPod.  Don&#8217;t you guys give a credit for bringing in dead iPods so the batteries can be recycled?&#8221;</p>
<p>Genius: &#8220;Only for iPods out of warranty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Me, head in hands: &#8220;I know that wasn&#8217;t your decision, but if you get the chance to talk to a superior, please tell them that is a stupid policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Genius: &#8220;Yeah.  So, what do you want to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Me: &#8220;Just replace it, I guess.  I&#8217;m only going to turn around and sell it on Craigslist, buy a shuffle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Genius: &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m a big shuffle advocate.  The clickwheels aren&#8217;t the most&#8230; <em>robust</em> iPods we&#8217;ve made.&#8221;</p>
<p>My replacement came in, and I bought a shuffle earlier today.  Haven&#8217;t used it yet.  My conversation with an Apple store checkout clerk leads me to believe it&#8217;s more <em>robust</em>.</p>
<p>Me, grabbing a 1GB shuffle out of a stack placed right by the registers for maximum impulse buying: &#8220;Yoink!&#8221;</p>
<p>Clerk: &#8220;Have you considered buying a protective case?&#8221;</p>
<p>Me: &#8220;I have considered it, and came to the conclusion that the shuffles are built out of a durable, high-density plastic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clerk: &#8220;One night my girlfriend was in a mood because I told her to get out and she went for a walk and was having a cry I guess and threw her shuffle against a brick wall and it still worked perfectly.  So you probably don&#8217;t need a case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Me: &#8220;Neat.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to not go back to the Apple store downtown for several weeks.</p>
