<h1>A Comcast Tip</h1>
<p>Many of the services one has to sign up for when moving can be taken care of with a phone call or a visit to a website.  It took me no more than five minutes apiece to get my natural gas and electricity set up.  Cable internet service, however, is another story.</p>
<p>My local provider is <a href="http://www.comcast.com">Comcast</a>.  There is effectively no competition in the cable arena where I live, and the only other broadband alternative is Verizon, whose <span class="caps">DSL</span> is comparatively slow and unreliable.  I called up Comcast and was informed that I needed to schedule an appointment for a technician to &#8220;install my service.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re moving into an apartment or a home that was previously wired for Comcast cable, you may not need to have a tech come out at an inconvenient time, look around, make sure the cable is hot, and start your service.  Try this:</p>
<p>Plug your cable modem (you have one, right?  only chumps rent&#8230;) into a cable outlet in your new place.  Get said modem talking to your computer and try browsing to any ol&#8217; web page.  Does it bounce you to a &#8220;Welcome to Comcast&#8221; type page?  Good.</p>
<p>Request new service from Comcast by phone or their website.  This gets your name and address in their database.  Just pick some random time for the installation; we won&#8217;t be needing it.</p>
<p>Wait an hour or so for your new account request to percolate in their database.  Don&#8217;t want to seem suspicious, do we?</p>
<p>Call up <em>technical support</em>, not sales.  Tell the nice person: &#8220;I have an appointment for new service, but I&#8217;ve plugged my cable modem in and it seems like my connection is ready to go, I see the &#8216;Welcome to Comcast&#8217; page and everything!  Is there any chance I can give you my <span class="caps">MAC</span> address and we can get this set up now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless you got a real dick of a tech, speaking their language usually works.  When they ask for it, read them your cable modem&#8217;s <span class="caps">MAC</span> address, which is often printed on a sticker affixed to the understand of the device.  You may also have to confirm your name, phone number, and address.  If everything&#8217;s good on their end you&#8217;ll be asked what username you want, and be given a randomly-generated password.</p>
<p>Before you hang up, restart your cable modem or use its management software to get a new <span class="caps">DHCP</span> lease.  Once it&#8217;s live again, make sure that you can get to a web site that isn&#8217;t in your browser&#8217;s cache.  If you can see the interwebs, you&#8217;re set.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done this twice now, in two different Comcast service areas, and it works great.  No muss, no fuss, no wasting a day waiting for the cable guy.  Oh, and don&#8217;t bother downloading the setup software that the &#8220;Welcome to Comcast&#8221; page links you to; it&#8217;s hugely outdated and unreliable, even by the admission of a Comcast tech.</p>
