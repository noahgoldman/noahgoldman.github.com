<h1>I Moved To San Francisco</h1>
<p>The past month has been blog-free in no small part because I was preparing to move to San Francisco from DC, my home for the better part of my 21 years.  On Saturday evening I got on a plane with two suitcases and my courier bag.  Three smallish boxes should arrive soon containing the rest of my worldly possessions: books, sundry tools and knickknacks, a set of speakers, and a sun lamp.  I sold my car, left my furniture to the individual taking my old apartment, and that was that.</p>
<p>I moved for a change of pace, a change of scenery, a change in personality.  I moved because living in the same place for two decades is not a growth experience on the whole.  I moved because I am starting a company with Phil, and he moved to San Francisco from DC, and he likes it, and he and his girlfriend had an affordable room to offer me.</p>
<p>My exhaustion after getting off the plane was put aside for our other roommate to take us all out to a couple of gay bars.  My roommates and I share one floor of an odd, multilevel house on an absurdly steep hill above Castro, the most decidedly gay neighborhood in the country.  I&#8217;m somewhat used to the gay social dynamic from years spent around DC&#8217;s Dupont Circle neighborhood but the Castro outdoes it in all respects.  At the top of the hill and a couple block&#8217;s walk is Cole Valley and then the Haight, the hippie mecca of the 1960s long since given way to a lengthy strip of boutiques.  Being at the cross-section of these two neighborhoods is interesting and pleasant, but assuming I stay in San Francisco for several years, it is not likely where I continue to live.</p>
<p>My immediate future: exploring neighborhoods, acquiring some semblance of furniture,   DefCon <span class="caps">CTF</span> development, and working like hell with Phil to get our endeavor off the ground.  Only the latter truly keeps me from homesick freakouts while I get my bearings in this new city.  That, and watching the otherworldly light of the California sunset fade from the sky, a memory from my mother&#8217;s childhood now mine.</p>
