<h1>Growing Up <span class="caps">HTML</span></h1>
<p>I instantly identified with Matthew Haughey&#8217;s recent post, <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/12/ten_years.html">Ten Years</a>, in which he describes the transformative experience of building his first web page.</p>
<p>My first glimpse of the &#8220;real&#8221; web – that is, outside the walls of <span class="caps">AOL</span>, Prodigy, or CompuServe – was pretty early on.  I spent much of my youth at <a href="http://www.american.edu/">American University</a>, where my mother teaches.  One afternoon a bored member of the English department office staff showed me this Mosaic thing the tech guys had recently installed on all the computers.  &#8220;Way better than Gopher, but there isn&#8217;t much to see yet.&#8221;  No matter.  I soaked it up.  I looked at just about everything there was to see on that infant web.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until a couple years later that we had an <span class="caps">ISP</span> at home that offered free web space for their customers.  I built my first home page, complete with hit counter.  From there I tried to start a Mac news site and, competition shaming my amateur attempt, subsequently refined my focus to Java on the Mac platform, then a hip topic.  My sites looked awful, but a generous soul working at a Mac-centric web host took it upon himself to hook me up with a copy of Photoshop.  I learned.  I played with the first crop of <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span> tools and went back to coding by hand.  I read <a href="http://webmonkey.com/">Webmonkey</a> religiously.  I had stumbled on something preternaturally compelling.</p>
<p>My first internship in web development didn&#8217;t technically exist; at age 12 I was too young to be issued a work permit in the District of Columbia.  I&#8217;m now 22.  Ten years.  I feel like I grew up building the web, and I guess I did.  No surprise, then, that for all my forays into information security and other fields, I always end up doing the web work.</p>
<p>The web&#8217;s in my blood, now.</p>
