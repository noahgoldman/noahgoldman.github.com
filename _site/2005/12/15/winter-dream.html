<h1>A Winter Dream</h1>
<p>As snow falls on my surroundings they become first obscured,  then hidden.  With the strip malls and office buildings out of sight I&#8217;m free to paint my own strokes on this new white canvas.  I can dream a winter dream, for in no other circumstances would this dream come to me.</p>
<p>In my dream I&#8217;m living in a city that I never feel estranged from.  I have no car, and no need for one; I experience the city on foot.  The climate is wet and green.  The rain is frequent, but it plays counterpoint to days of idyllic sunshine.</p>
<p>In my dream I live in a small apartment â€“ not as small as the one I live in now, but small.  My mattress lies on bare floor.  In the kitchen there&#8217;s an aging gas range and a comically large pair of food and water dishes for a dog.  These are necessary because in my dream I live with a comically large dog.  This dog occupies a fair portion of the mattress on the floor for much of the day and almost the entirety of the mattress when I attempt to sleep there.  I am good-natured about this because the dog is my constant companion.</p>
<p>In my dream I wake up to no alarm clock.  I rise when I am ready.  I feed the dog, but not myself, because in my dream as in real life I do not particularly like breakfast.  I cull the stack of emails and news that have come to me while I slept.  Then the dog and I go for a run in the warm, sporadic rain.  We take in the smell of the city.  It smells good.</p>
<p>In my dream I work all afternoon and into the early evening.  I work mostly for people I&#8217;ve never met face-to-face.  I write code, and I write news, and I write articles.  Maybe I&#8217;m writing a book.  I write a lot.  I spend several of these late afternoons per week in a coffee shop where they let my dog sleep at my feet while I work.  Then I take the dog home, promise that I&#8217;ll be back later, and walk to a small bar where I mix records for the patrons off my laptop.  I am paid with good bourbon.  When I return home, the dog punishes my abscence by refusing to move, having already sprawled out on the entirety of the mattress.  I sleep good-naturedly on the couch.</p>
<p>In my dream I wake up the next morning and decide to go for a long walk instead of a run, because the weather demands it.  I&#8217;m walking through a park when my dog is approached by a beautiful woman.  When she&#8217;s done complimenting the dog she strikes up a conversation with me, and soon I realize that the routine I&#8217;ve become accustomed to is about to change.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never had this dream asleep.</p>
