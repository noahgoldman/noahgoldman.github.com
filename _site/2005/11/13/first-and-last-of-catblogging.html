<h1>The First and Last of the Catblogging</h1>
<p>When I was in San Francisco the constant presence of dogs sparked in me a strong desire to have a pet.  It was suggested to me by a friend that I might consider getting a girlfriend first, and then see if I still wanted a pet.  I&#8217;ve dated a bit since I&#8217;ve been back in DC.  I still wanted a pet.</p>
<p>This past week I adopted a cat from the <a href="http://alexandriaanimals.org/~awla/main.cfm">Vola Lawson Animal Shelter</a> in Alexandria.   I&#8217;d wanted a cat when I was a kid but my mother was terribly allergic.  She tells me I once suggested that she sleep in the yard so I could keep a cat in the house.  I neither confirm nor deny this childhood memory.  Needless to say, we had dogs growing up, and I consider myself a &#8220;dog person&#8221; if I&#8217;m forced to choose.  If my living situation allowed I&#8217;d have a very, very large dog like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_dane">Great Dane</a> or an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_wolfhound">Irish wolfhound</a>.</p>
<p>The cat I adopted is three, largely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_coon">Maine Coon</a> with the breed-typical mid-length brown tabby coat and black tail.  He&#8217;s personable to the point of neediness, though I suspect this due to a lack of human contact while in the shelter.  Any time spent in my apartment not attending to him is, in his gold eyes, time misspent, and I&#8217;m soundly reprimanded for it.  He forces his nose against my hand until I&#8217;ve scratched him about the head appropriately and will repeat this, switching hands, until he finally settles into a doze.  This guided petting seems to be his activity of preference; toys, treats, scratching, and food are wholly secondary.</p>
<p>I named him Case, after William Gibson&#8217;s protagonists in <em>Neuromancer</em> and <em>Pattern Recognition</em>, male and female respectively.  It seemed a fitting name given the androgyny of felines.  My friends, meanwhile, have conspired to refer to the beast as Chairman Meow, or simply The Chairman.</p>
<p>I understand the grave responsibility that befalls any cat-owning blogger.  I will not, henceforth, post about the cat again, save in passing or upon its eventual death.  I will not post pictures of it.  I will not share any cat-related &#8220;wisdom&#8221; that finds its way to me in the course of pet ownership.  I will not be able to get the cat hair out of my laptop&#8217;s keyboard, ever.</p>
