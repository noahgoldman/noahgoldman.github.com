<h1>More Dashboard Dementia</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m not alone in my <a href="http://al3x.net/articles/2005/07/08/dashboard-s-damage">Dashboard-bashing</a>.<br />
Leon Breedt <a href="http://blog.xeraph.org/articles/2005/07/10/take-back-your-latency">suggests</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn off Dashboard with <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/18261,performance">DashOnOff</a> and<br />
notice how you get real-time typing back. I want to say &#8220;Woo&#8221; but I&#8217;m not sure its that much of an<br />
achievement when it should not have been an issue to start with :) It can?̢<cite>̢</cite>t have been memory,<br />
my PowerBook was never thrashing (and it has 1.5GB of memory, more than my desktop PC, constantly<br />
hovering at around 700MB free, even with Dashboard). Now I?̢<cite>̢</cite>m wondering if it was a rogue<br />
widget, or if Dashboard just likes the taste of <span class="caps">CPU</span> in the morning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing is, Leon shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about &#8220;rogue widgets&#8221; eating his machine alive.  Apple should have built the walls on the Dashboard sandbox high enough that all the little widgets can&#8217;t hurt themselves – or anyone else.</p>
<p>Andrew Orlowski of the Register relays <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/26/tiger_ui_review/">more concerns</a>, albeit with a grain of salt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Apple&#8217;s own support boards, concern about the performance impact of Dashboard is widely<br />
expressed. But this is overstated, and isn&#8217;t the real issue with Dashboard. (With 30MB free memory –<br />
on a machine with 1.5GB of <span class="caps">RAM</span> – Dashboard claims half of what&#8217;s available when invoked. It<br />
doesn&#8217;t matter how many widgets are active. The memory is slowly reclaimed by the garbage collector,<br />
and this compares very favorably with Konfabulator, a clunky rip-off of Stardock&#8217;s DesktopX product<br />
for Windows.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s two voices suggesting that Dashboard isn&#8217;t a memory hog.  All I know is, flipping the switch in DashOnOff freed up 200MB.  It&#8217;s like having a new machine.  Or at least like having Panther back.  Orlowski then gets to the nitty-gritty of the Dashboard folly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real issue with Dashboard is that it&#8217;s a solution looking for a problem. We&#8217;ve had<br />
equivalents such as Desktop X and Konfabulator for several years now, and they&#8217;ve yielded thousands<br />
of clocks, media controllers and dancing Hula girls. Shed the gimmicks and redundant applications<br />
and what&#8217;s left isn&#8217;t too different from the set of desk accessories that shipped with the original<br />
Mac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless, killing Dashboard forced me to refine my workflow.  I was already consolidating more activities into Safari: <span class="caps">RSS</span> reading, fast searching via <a href="http://haoli.dnsalias.com/Saft/">Saft</a> shortcuts, using bookmarklets for things like easy del.icio.us additions.  Now I&#8217;ve gone back to peppering my toolbar bookmarks with shortcuts to the sort of information I was checking regularly with Dashboard, like a local weather report.  And you know what?  Being able to see detailed information on the day&#8217;s weather without clicking through from a widget to Safari is just better.  Or at the very least, it&#8217;s not <em>redundant</em>.</p>
<p>Rather than half-assing my note-taking with the deplorably limited sticky widget I&#8217;m now getting more out of <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">QuickSilver</a> and its Text Manipulation Actions plugin, judiciously taking notes via a workflow like this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Bring up QuickSilver.</li>
	<li>Hit &#8220;.&#8221; (period) to bring up an input field.</li>
	<li>Type my note.</li>
	<li>Tab to actions and navigate to &#8220;Append to&#8230;&#8221;</li>
	<li>Tab to items and choose the &#8220;Scratch.txt&#8221; document that I&#8217;ve explicitly added to the QuickSilver catalog.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s five steps, but damned if it takes more than a couple seconds once you have it down.  The next time I want my notes I flip over to <a href="http://www.macromates.com/">TextMate</a> – which stays open most of the time – and check out Scratch.txt, which I keep in a broader &#8220;Notes&#8221; project.  If I just want to get there by the content of my notes I can always use Spotlight.  Or hell, I could use QuickSilver to get to the file.  No matter how I do it, it fits a familiar workflow, not zooming me off to the magical Dashboard realm of tiny applications that obey few rules and behave as they will.</p>
<p>While rounding out my Dashboard-free setup I&#8217;ve come to re-appreciate just how brilliant <a href="http://www.iconfactory.com/ip_home.asp">iPulse</a> is (I know <a href="http://holeinthebox.com/">Scott</a> is with me on this).  One glance at the Dock or flip of Expose&#8217;s &#8220;reveal desktop&#8221; hot corner and I&#8217;ve got a compact yet informative view of most everything going on with my system.  iPulse doesn&#8217;t eat <span class="caps">RAM</span> or chew <span class="caps">CPU</span> cycles.  Best of all, its elegance is decidedly Mac-like: a better way to display complex and &#8220;un-humane&#8221; information.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I didn&#8217;t mean to suggest in my last post on this topic that Apple shipped OS X 10.4 at the expense of quality features.  There are superb and well-concieved improvements all over Tiger, and even Dashboard was an answer to some demand and interest from the Mac community.  It&#8217;s undeniable, however, that Tiger is a step down from Panther in terms of overall quality control, riddled as it is with interface inconsistencies and odd performance issues.</p>
<p>Dashboard may have its place for some users, but its development should have taken a back seat to resolving more substantial problems.  Apple has always been about balancing innovation with quality.  I don&#8217;t want to see that change.</p>
