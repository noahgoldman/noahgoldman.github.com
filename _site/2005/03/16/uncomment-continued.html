<h1>Uncomment, Continued</h1>
<p>The first question/request about the new blog engine came from my friend Brittany, of late the author of knitting blog <a href="http://www.yarnballs.com">Yarn Balls</a>.  Her question: &#8220;how do I post comments?&#8221;</p>
<p>The short answer: you don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I disabled comments while I was running WordPress due to the insufferable crush of comment spam.  While I&#8217;ve had some ideas about a comment system that would be both usable and reduce spam, I decided not to implement it yet.  Spam, however, did not cap this decision.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always had a kind of mistrust or skepticism about comments.  Perhaps it comes from having watched Slashdot and similar communities dissolve into a raving, blithering, irrelevant cacophony.  Perhaps it was seeing how, time after time on blog after blog, comments would inevitably be turned off when discussion on a post got too heated.  My instinct was, and is, that comments are most often worthless in small doses and fatal in large ones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had some useful, insightful, funny, and informative comments in the history of this weblog.  I don&#8217;t see a lot of commenting overall, which is fine with me.  But the ratio of provocative TrackBacks, IMs, and emails I&#8217;ve gotten versus provocative comments on posts here has furthered my opinion.  Readers motivated enough to write a post on their own weblog, type out an email to me, or engage me in realtime conversation generally have more to say, or not much to say but a context in which to sound out other thoughts.  Comments as a medium do not encourage goodness, essentially.</p>
<p>It was happenstance that my &#8220;iTunes Chatting&#8221; story made the rounds while comments were disabled here, but I&#8217;m infinitely grateful it was the case.  Even the more ribbing responses that tracked back to the post were still articulate and engaging.  All twentysomething of them.  That sent a pretty clear message to me.</p>
<p>So comments will remain off, though old comments will be displayed.  I look forward, however, to your TrackBacks, your IMs, and your emails.</p>
