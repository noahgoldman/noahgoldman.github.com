<h1>They Stopped Calling It Rendezvous</h1>
<p>A while back I was quoted in a <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,61177,00.html">Wired News article</a> about iTunes library sharing.  I had totally forgotten about that until this evening.</p>
<p>I parked myself in Murky VA, my lackluster de facto &#8220;third place,&#8221; and opened up iTunes.  Before I hopped on Bassdrive or another streaming station I had a look at the sole shared iTunes music library in a sea of PowerBooks: maria&#8217;s music.  I browsed.  <strong>What a fucking music collection</strong>.  Not in size, not that many albums really.  But content-wise, things I&#8217;ve not seen outside of, well, my collection: multiple Muslimguaze albums, scads of shoegaze and post-rock, Angelo Badalamenti&#8217;s soundtrack to <em>Twin Peaks</em>, for fucksakes.</p>
<p>It had to belong to the girl with dark hair by the counter.  I saw her when I got my coffee.  Took note, lovely.  Her.  Her?</p>
<p>There is no music on my PowerBook.  I offloaded my library to a drive that is to remain perpetually hooked up to my new Mac mini, serving away at home.  Nonetheless, I shared my empty library out under the name maria i sweat your music collection &lt;3.</p>
<p>I waited.  I listened to selections from her library: Low, Manual.  And then the sound skipped.  I flipped to iTunes.  Her library title had changed: try_the_new_dalek.</p>
<p>A conversation began, conducted solely by library title, and it continued for the next couple of hours. At one point I offered my <span class="caps">AIM</span> screenname, identified myself as the kid with the 3 on the back of his neck.  She didn&#8217;t talk to me online.  She didn&#8217;t leave her table to talk to me in the coffee shop.  I didn&#8217;t dare approach her, personal space and all that.  But we kept talking.</p>
<p>She noted, at one point, that I was thieving her music via <a href="http://ourtunes.sf.net">ourTunes</a>.  She noted the application specifically, and by that <span class="caps">URL</span>; perhaps she had a clear view of my PowerBook&#8217;s display?  We exchanged other music recommendations, commented on shows.  i don&#8217;t know art but i know what i like.  But of course.</p>
<p>And then: sorry gotta go.  The girl in corner with dark hair packs up and bustles the hell out of there, probably afraid I&#8217;d just <em>have</em> to talk to her.  Don&#8217;t call it social technology.</p>
<p>maria: I have 703.4MB of your music.  Beautiful, sad music.</p>
<p>Shared taste means nothing, I tell myself.</p>
