<h1>What Technology Values</h1>
<p>As part of their reporting on recent events in the Middle East last week, <span class="caps">NPR</span> ran a story called <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/02/17/133847146/Internet-Freedom-And-U-S-State-Department">Internet Freedom and the US State Department</a>. The story is an interview with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Ross_(innovator)">Alec Ross</a>, co-founder of nonprofit technology provider <a href="http://www.one-economy.com/">One Economy</a> and now <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10212930-38.html">Senior Advisor for Innovation</a> to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>While dodging hard questions about US companies selling restrictive or invasive technologies to repressive regimes, Mr. Ross made a statement that jumped out at me from my car stereo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;[T]echnology itself is value-neutral. It depends on how a government chooses to use these technologies.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this is an unproductive, misguided, and all too common way of thinking about technology.</p>
<h2>What Technology Is</h2>
<p>The word &#8220;technology&#8221; can refer to many things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The process of human beings inventing tools that improve our quality of life.</li>
	<li>A particular tool from the above category.</li>
	<li>An industry or amalgamation of industries producing said tools.</li>
	<li>The future.</li>
	<li>Change.</li>
	<li>Dehumanization.</li>
	<li>Progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Because technology is such a malleable concept, it&#8217;s frequently repurposed for political rhetoric. Want to celebrate human achievement? Technology. Want to bemoan how we&#8217;re frittering our lives away on silly gadgets? Technology. Guns? Technology. Advances in treating gunshot wounds? That&#8217;s technology too. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_vs._the_Eighteenth_Amendment">alcohol</a>, technology seems to be the cause of and solution to all of life&#8217;s problems.</p>
<p>Having found it to be a near-empty rhetorical vessel, it would seem that we&#8217;re able to side with Mr. Ross in declaring technology &#8220;value-neutral&#8221;. We could stop here, save one important factor that changes it all.</p>
<h2>Technology is Made of People</h2>
<p>Technology is <strong>not an abstract entity</strong>. Technology, like art or literature or music or mathematics, is a human endeavor. It is made by people and, as such, is imbued with their values, hopes, foibles, and passions.</p>
<p>All too often our mental concept of technology is that of a creeping and cold alien force, forever replicating and destroying everything in its path. When we think of the evils of technology, we think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)">The Borg</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Smith">Agent Smith</a>: something hostile and increasingly pervasive whose origin is unclear but whose intent is clearly malice towards all things human.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remind ourselves that technology is not such a villainous force. It&#8217;s not a force at all. No technology – good or evil, exceptional or mundane – is built in a vacuum. No technology is built without human intervention.</p>
<p>Even the most bureaucratic of technologies can&#8217;t be claimed to be un-opinionated or free from our values. The lowly <span class="caps">SQL</span> database, workhorse of dismal trades like accounting and business analytics, is theoretically &#8220;value-neutral&#8221; to the data it stores. Yet, in structuring data into rows and columns of particular standard types, a set of values emerges that dictates what information is and how it should be stored and queried. Dig in to the <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/9780596801670/sql/feedback_and_evolution">history behind <span class="caps">SQL</span></a> and you&#8217;ll find values and opinions aplenty.</p>
<p>If technology was indeed &#8220;value-neutral&#8221;, why would the drama of competing technologies and the personas behind them have dominated headlines for decades? Whether Mac versus PC or MySpace versus Facebook, it&#8217;s clear that the values inherent in particular technologies aid in forming social clusters around those technologies. This doesn&#8217;t even begin to touch on biomedical technologies, some of which threaten our values so deeply that we regulate and ban them.</p>
<h2>Technology Values What People Value</h2>
<p>Saying that &#8220;technology itself is value-neutral&#8221; shows a misunderstanding of the basic nature of an essential component of human society. To further wave off a political and moral responsibility to regulate technology and ensure that it&#8217;s deployed in the interest of human rights is, to say the least, <em>puzzling</em> coming from someone with a track record of using technology in positive ways.</p>
<p>Our <em>idea</em> of technology appears to have supplanted the <em>reality</em> of technology, at least in the minds of our officials. Technology is not an invisible force; it is not still air waiting to be blown hither or thither. No, technology is the work of people, and insofar as technology &#8220;values&#8221; anything, it reflects the values of its creators and users. Technology is born with intent. We ignore that intent at our peril.</p>
