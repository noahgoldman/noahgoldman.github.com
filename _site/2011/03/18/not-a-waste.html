<article class="post">
<h1>Not A Waste</h1>
<p>Last night, after several long days, I was clicking through news and found a recent blog post by self-styled &#8220;solopreneur&#8221; Justin Vincent. Its title, <a href="http://justinvincent.com/page/1392/entreporn-the-fallacy-that-wastes-your-life">Entreporn, The Fallacy That Wastes Your Life</a>, sort of says it all, but it&#8217;s worth a read to understand the perspective of a vocal minority in the tech industry.</p>
<p>Frustrated by what I read, and by the <a href="http://unicornfree.com/">post that inspired it</a> from longtime acquaintance Amy Hoy, I left a ragey, unnecessarily personal, and vitriolic <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2338911">comment</a>. I&#8217;d like to clarify that comment and my broader position on the discussion.</p>
<h2>Regarding Freckle</h2>
<p>I said two things that, were I still able to edit my comment, I would now remove:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The phrase &#8220;duping credulous customers&#8221;. This is a stupid, loaded phrase. No reasonable person is being duped by Amy Hoy&#8217;s <a href="http://letsfreckle.com/">Freckle</a> time tracking product. Her customers have ample information with which to make a decision to subscribe to the service.</li>
	<li>The word &#8220;overpaying&#8221;. This is too subjective. For a certain type of freelancer, Freckle may be well worth the monthly outlay. Value is relative.</li>
</ol>
<p>To be clear: I <em>did</em> mean to call out Freckle and its creator, in no small part because she dishes it out when it comes to business and startups. I intentionally didn&#8217;t mention her by name because I wanted to imply that online time-tracking tools aimed at freelancers are not exactly in short supply. My jerky comments could have been describing Freckle, but they also could have described a dozen other web applications.</p>
<p>At any rate, I should have omitted the above two items and engaged in more civil discourse.</p>
<h2>Wasn&#8217;t There More Here Before?</h2>
<p>Earlier today, there was the more of a blog post here. The original content is still available if you look for it, but I&#8217;d prefer if you didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I tried to argue a very difficult-to-communicate point, and I largely failed. What I wrote baffled and infuriated friends and strangers alike. Some people got the gist of what I was trying to say, but most didn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s an idea that is probably better expressed through action than through words.</p>
<p>I have been in the habit of writing here to explore ideas that I&#8217;m struggling with. Perhaps it&#8217;s time to break that habit and find another avenue for those ideas. I&#8217;ve come to that conclusion before, and the fact that I&#8217;m coming to it again is telling.</p>
<p>Apologies to Amy, and to you, reader, for wasting your time.</p>
