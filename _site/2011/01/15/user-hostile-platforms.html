<h1>Shortchanging Your Business with User-Hostile Platforms</h1>
<p>After yet another <a href="http://status.37signals.com/">Campfire outage</a> this week (albeit a brief one), I went looking for an alternative group chat solution for our distributed team at <a href="https://www.banksimple.com/">BankSimple</a>. Griping on Twitter led to a number of suggestions, and we gave the most frequently occurring suggestion a try.</p>
<p>This post isn&#8217;t about group chat tools. I didn&#8217;t want to call out the service we tried (and ultimately abandoned) because they don&#8217;t deserve to be badmouthed. They&#8217;ve built a superior product to Campfire, and their team was friendly, gracious, and willing to entertain our suggestions and inquiries. But after posting this, one of the service&#8217;s developers told me to name them, so: it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hipchat.com/">HipChat</a>. They stand by what they&#8217;ve built, and I admire that.</p>
<p>This post is about platforms and doing the right thing by your customers. It&#8217;s about the one big thing that I think HipChat and some other great companies are doing wrong.</p>
<p>HipChat can be used in two ways: in a web browser or as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Integrated_Runtime">Adobe <span class="caps">AIR</span></a> application. After signing up, you&#8217;re pushed pretty hard to use the <span class="caps">AIR</span> app. The web interface has a persistent callout to install the <span class="caps">AIR</span> app, and some key features are only available in the <span class="caps">AIR</span> version.</p>
<p>My team experienced a number of the usual problems one has with <span class="caps">AIR</span> applications: lousy performance, odd interface bugs, key combinations and UI elements that didn&#8217;t conform to our operating system. <span class="caps">AIR</span> apps exist in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a> between a web application and a desktop application, and the result is unsettling and annoying. Pretty soon, we were itching to go back to Campfire (via the native Mac client <a href="http://propaneapp.com/">Propane</a>), even though HipChat has better features and the promise of improved reliability.</p>
<p>When I asked HipChat&#8217;s developers about their use of <span class="caps">AIR</span>, the response boiled down to: &#8220;we&#8217;re a small team, our customers are mostly on Windows, and <span class="caps">AIR</span> lets us provide a cross-platform desktop app to the maximum number of customers with the least amount of effort&#8221;. It&#8217;s a case study for <span class="caps">AIR</span>, really: a tiny web shop that&#8217;s able to ship a desktop app because <span class="caps">AIR</span> reuses their existing skills and knowledge. So what&#8217;s the problem?</p>
<h2>Mystery Meat</h2>
<p>At first, I simply accepted the explanation. But the more I thought about it, the more it bugged me. It seemed like a decision that had everything to do with what&#8217;s in the best interests of the business, and little to do with what&#8217;s good for their customers.</p>
<p>Imagine a new restaurant that wants to make the most of their burgeoning lunch traffic. They start serving low-quality meat: after all, it&#8217;s cheap, plentiful, and requires nothing more than placing a different order with their distributor. For a few weeks, profits are up. But pretty soon, so are customer complaints, and the stars on their Yelp page are rapidly dwindling. The owner doesn&#8217;t understand. The meat isn&#8217;t great, sure, but it&#8217;s perfectly edible, and for a while it seemed like the restaurant was making more money and attracting new customers. What went wrong?</p>
<p><span class="caps">AIR</span>, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_widget_toolkits#Cross-platform">cross-platform widget toolkits</a> and application frameworks that came before it, is the gray mystery meat of client-side software. It gets the job done, but it&#8217;s hard to stomach. For anyone who used a computer in the 1990s, <span class="caps">AIR</span> probably brings back scarring memories of Java apps: slow, ugly, inconsistent, awkward.</p>
<h2>Do People Really Want Native Apps?</h2>
<p>It sure seems that way. Five minutes of searching produced this list:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://help.rdio.com/discussions/desktop/87-feature-request-non-air-version-of-player">Rdio users want a native app</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://support.mog.com/discussions/suggestions/70-native-desktop-app-not-adobe-air"><span class="caps">MOG</span> users want a native app</a>, and specifically <em>not an <span class="caps">AIR</span> app</em>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/pandora/topics/plans_for_a_pandora_client#reply_3570108">Pandora users want a native app</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/forums/ideas/3007/">Remember The Milk users have wanted a native app since 2007</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/09/01/what-happened-to-adobe-air-today-no-one-seems-to-know/">Yammer users want a native app</a>.</li>
	<li>TweetDeck users want a native app. In comparison with other apps, <a href="http://www.davidalison.com/2009/04/tweetdeck-vs-nambu-vs-tweetie.html">native is a strength</a>; or in more absolute terms, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/2009/04/07/night-cheated-tweetdeck/">native is native</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wherever you see <span class="caps">AIR</span> apps, there are support forum threads opened by customers asking for a native alternative, and usually a moderator explaining that they just don&#8217;t &#8220;have the time&#8221; to do native apps for each platform. You see the same thing for popular services that only offer in-browser Flash apps. On Twitter, a significant majority of people seem to <a href="http://amplicate.com/hate/adobe-air">hate <span class="caps">AIR</span></a> if sentiment analysis is any indication.</p>
<p>Where developers can, they&#8217;ll create unsupported third-party native apps for services that only offer <span class="caps">AIR</span> or Flash, even if those apps end up requiring frequent maintenance to stay in sync with the services they talk to. Propane, aforementioned, is one such application. <a href="http://www.bitcartel.com/pandorajam/">PandoraJam</a> is another, and an interesting case study. Because Pandora doesn&#8217;t offer an <span class="caps">API</span>, the developers of PandoraJam are forever playing catch-up when the streaming music service changes its design or functionality. Still, PandoraJam&#8217;s developers and users suffer through the glitches and updates because they&#8217;d rather have a native app. I think that&#8217;s telling.</p>
<h2>Real Talk</h2>
<p>What you&#8217;re communicating with a poorly-done <span class="caps">AIR</span> app is that your business priorities – namely, saving time and money – are more important than what your customers want.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have time&#8221; is the common excuse for delivering an <span class="caps">AIR</span> app instead of a good native app. Money, though, can buy someone else&#8217;s time. For a price, you can find a great contractor to build a native app for any platform under the sun. Yes, you have to spend some time managing the relationship with that contractor. It&#8217;s an investment. Eventually, unless you&#8217;ve misjudged your market, the investment should pay off.</p>
<p>Humans are gifted with extremely sensitive bullshit detectors. The average computer user may not internalize the difference between an <span class="caps">AIR</span> app and a native app, but he knows when something doesn&#8217;t feel right or work correctly. Your tech-stunted uncle may not ever request a native application with that terminology, but he&#8217;ll sure complain about his computer acting funny when he experiences the oddities of an <span class="caps">AIR</span> app.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just about <span class="caps">AIR</span>, of course. As mobile apps become a mandatory part of doing business, more and more <a href="http://funkatron.com/site/comments/building-cross-platform-mobile-apps/">cross-platform mobile frameworks</a> are cropping up. As with every cross-platform framework to date, only one in a pile of the resulting applications might even begin to pass for native. These apps <em>just ain&#8217;t right</em>, and people can tell.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Nobody uses <span class="caps">AIR</span> because it delivers better-quality desktop apps. Companies build <span class="caps">AIR</span> apps because they&#8217;re short on time and cash and wary of investing in development and maintenance that&#8217;s outside their area of expertise. This is understandable, but shortsighted, and a lot of companies are about to make the same mistake in the mobile arena.</p>
<p>Cross-platform solutions like <span class="caps">AIR</span> might be better for your business in the short term, but your customers probably hate it, and you could be shortchanging yourself in the long run. If there&#8217;s a market, spend the time and money to build proper native desktop and mobile apps. If you don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a market but the demand is there, expose an <span class="caps">API</span> to your service, let inspired developers build native apps, and see what happens.</p>
<p>Doing things the right way is hard. People respond to quality, though: they reward it, in no small part because quality such a rarity in the software marketplace. Do right by your customers and they&#8217;ll do right by you.</p>
<h2>Postscript, January 16 2011</h2>
<p>This post generated quite a few responses. Having slept on it and mulled over the responses, I&#8217;ve made <a href="https://github.com/al3x/al3x.github.com/commits/master">a few edits</a>, including naming the chat service in question at the developer&#8217;s request. I&#8217;ve also tried to tone down the fierier bits.</p>
<p>I liked <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/2785179631/things-communicated">Merlin Mann&#8217;s response</a>, and it made me excise a particularly off-the-rails portion of the post. You really do see the &#8220;we don&#8217;t have time&#8221; excuse over and over again if you search around for native app requests, though; I wasn&#8217;t trying to set up a straw man. I think a lot of developers genuinely would like to do a native app, but they&#8217;re hesitant to make the investment. They&#8217;re not all developers on one platform who have stoutly declared that they won&#8217;t produce for any other platform like the Mac heavyweights he cites. Still, Merlin&#8217;s point is a good one: developers don&#8217;t have to build something for a different platform if that&#8217;s not what they love doing.</p>
<p>I got an interesting email from the developer of <a href="http://jamcloud.com/">JamCloud</a> who claims that the poor performance of many <span class="caps">AIR</span> apps is avoidable by using AS3 and not Flex. I don&#8217;t know enough about <span class="caps">AIR</span> internals to validate that statement, but an alpha version of JamCloud does indeed perform well on my machine.</p>
<p>I got another email from the developer of <a href="http://www.realsoftware.com/"><span class="caps">REAL</span> Studio</a> who claims that his cross-platform solution produces performant applications with native widgets. I like their <a href="http://www.realsoftware.com/realstudio/qualityapps.php">Quality Applications</a> page. It&#8217;s nice to know that they&#8217;re thinking about quality and not just selling the ability to get an app out the door quickly.</p>
<p>I received several emails and comments from ex-<span class="caps">AIR</span> developers and businesses that had tried <span class="caps">AIR</span> and found that it didn&#8217;t meet their needs. But then, I also received some ruffled tweets from current Adobe tools developers who love <span class="caps">AIR</span>. Interestingly, I didn&#8217;t receive a single tweet, comment, or email from a <em>user</em> of an <span class="caps">AIR</span> application who thought that <span class="caps">AIR</span> made his favorite application better.</p>
<p>Finally, Ed Finkler has posted <a href="http://funkatron.com/site/comments/notes-on-shortchanging-your-business-with-user-hostile-platforms/">a great reply</a> that brings up the fuzzy boundary between native and non-native, and the important point that &#8220;native&#8221; does not guarantee &#8220;well-designed&#8221; and vice versa. To his mind, developers can go the extra mile to make cross-platform apps that users will love. I don&#8217;t have anything against cross-platform technology itself, so I hope he&#8217;s right.</p>
