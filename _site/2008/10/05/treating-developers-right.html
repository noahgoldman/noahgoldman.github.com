<h1>Treating Developers Right</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the idea for a quotation-capturing application for the Mac for some time. It&#8217;s been towards the top of my list of <a href="http://www.al3x.net/2008/02/on-side-projects.html">side-projects</a> for ages, held in place by Cocoa&#8217;s steep learning curve (easy to get started, takes years of experience to do an app right).</p>
<p>It recently occurred to me that this application would work even better on the iPhone, and that the smaller &#8220;surface area&#8221; of the iPhone <span class="caps">SDK</span> might make the project more approachable. I applied to be an iPhone developer and began consuming Apple&#8217;s materials for developers as I waited for approval.</p>
<p>That was two weeks ago. In the intervening time, Apple has <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/10/01/iphone-nda-dropped/">disbanded the <span class="caps">NDA</span></a> on the iPhone developer program, which indicates that they&#8217;re responding to pressure from Android starting to materialize as a viable and open mobile development platform. It&#8217;s disheartening that it takes a market threat in order for Apple to do the right thing by their developers.</p>
<p>My full-time job is looking after Twitter&#8217;s developer community. Twitter&#8217;s and Apple&#8217;s respective developer technologies are very different beasts, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine treating our developers the way Apple treats theirs and still having a community to speak of.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear about Apple&#8217;s iPhone developer program: you&#8217;re paying them. That means they should work for you. If they don&#8217;t, you should fire them. If Apple can&#8217;t afford to support their developer community at $99 per year per developer, they should charge more. But in the two weeks that I&#8217;ve been <em>waiting for Apple to give me permission to pay them</em>, I&#8217;ve come to realize that my free time is better spent on side-projects that I have more control over.</p>
<p>At Twitter, our developers don&#8217;t pay us a dime, and we don&#8217;t currently have a formalized quality of service policy that obliges us to any particular behavior. Still, leaving developers hanging without support for two weeks is unthinkable to me.</p>
<p>Treating developers right isn&#8217;t difficult: be open, be honest, and respect their time. When we&#8217;ve failed to keep to those rules, developers are rightly pissed. When we keep to them, our developers are happy. For the sake of my friends in the Mac development community, I hope Apple figures these simple rules out.</p>
