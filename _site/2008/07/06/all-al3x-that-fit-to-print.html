<h1>All The al3x That&#8217;s Fit to Print</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/technology/06outage.html">New York Times</a> today.  It feels weird.</p>
<p>I talked to the reporter over the phone three weeks ago.  A week later, they decided to get the story ready for press and sent out a photographer.  I happened to be at my father&#8217;s home in Northern Virginia on a trip back to the DC area.  Hence the wallpaper.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy with my place in the story, but part of me wishes it was a project I was more passionate about.  I made <a href="http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/">downforeveryoneorjustme.com</a> for a friend on a whim, utterly unconnected to my work at Twitter.  I&#8217;ve spent maybe six hours on the site, total, ever.  Most of that was setting up the domain and hosting and doing the original Ruby implementation.  I then spent a couple hours moving it over to Python for <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a> with the idea that I wouldn&#8217;t have to think about uptime.  As the story mentions, that didn&#8217;t exactly work out, but it&#8217;s been better than futzing with a <span class="caps">VPS</span> or three.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good that a conversation about the cultural and business implications of downtime is starting, or perhaps continuing and deepening.  It&#8217;s certainly something I&#8217;ve been forcibly immersed over the last year and a half of helping to keep Twitter afloat.  But it&#8217;s also a conversation I&#8217;m weary of.</p>
<p>Of late, I&#8217;ve tried as much as possible to focus my time at Twitter on building a new system that works at scale and does so predictably and measurably.  That&#8217;s not easy when the current system is still on fire.  So much of the last year of my professional life has been spent reaching for buckets of water that it&#8217;s hard to stop myself from trying to stomp out every new blaze.  If I don&#8217;t, though, the new components that we hope will make the system work get pushed out further and further.</p>
<p>Figuring out how to work on version 2.0 while part of the team is maintaining the 1.x series is a classic software development management problem, and one that&#8217;s only become more complicated in the web application development space.  The web offers incredible freedom to see if an idea will succeed in the marketplace.  The trade-off is that once you have a successful idea, you only have so long to make it as dependable as death and taxes.</p>
<p>At Twitter, we&#8217;re well aware that we have essentially the most patient and forgiving set of users we could ever hope for.  I don&#8217;t intend to test their patience a moment longer than we have to.  In the meantime, seeing our site occasionally float to the top of the request patterns for <a href="http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/">downforeveryoneorjustme.com</a> is a stark reminder of all the work we have left to do.</p>
