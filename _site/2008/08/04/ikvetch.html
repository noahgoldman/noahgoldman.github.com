<article class="post">
<h1>iKvetch</h1>
<p>My friends and coworkers have endured my unending complaints about the iPhone ever since the App Store-enabled 2.0 firmware landed.  Now, you can too.  Hooray for blogs.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The 1.0 iPhone was the best phone I&#8217;ve ever owned.  It was simple but powerful and utterly reliable.  It worked so well that it was difficult to have much of a conversation about it when it was still a conversation piece.  &#8220;Yup, love it, works great, buy one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 2.0 iPhone, conversely, is not the best phone I&#8217;ve ever owned.  It&#8217;s maybe third- or fourth-best; doesn&#8217;t really matter.  What matters is that I don&#8217;t trust the thing anymore.  Once you lose trust, all the beauty falls away.  (That&#8217;s a life lesson, kids; it applies to more than phones.)</p>
<p>Before the iPhone launched, I <a href="http://www.al3x.net/2007/01/what-closed-iphone-means_11.html">thought I wanted native third-party applications</a>.  I thought that web applications weren&#8217;t enough.  Now that I have native third-party applications on the iPhone, I regret ever wanting them.  For some web applications like <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> that have put out iPhone apps, I&#8217;ve actually gone back to the web versions because I like things that, y&#8217;know, work.</p>
<h2>The Suck</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna put &#8216;em on the table.  *There hasn&#8217;t been an app released yet that improves my iPhone experience.*  Sure, there are a bunch that <em>would</em> improve my iPhone experience if they <em>worked reliably</em>, but they don&#8217;t.  With one baffling exception.</p>
<p>Games.  <em>Enigmo</em> looks beautiful and works flawlessly on the iPhone.  It&#8217;s doing all sorts of 3D and physics simulations and environmental audio and I think maybe my taxes in the background.  So what the shit is going on with applications that display a few rows of text and  LET&#8217;S <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">GET</span> <span class="caps">CRAZY</span> <span class="caps">HERE</span>  an image or two?</p>
<p>The answer, as I understand it, is that the text view class that Apple provides to developers is feature-crippled.  This necessitates hacks and abuses of WebKit views, which in turn results in the molasses-slow user experience that most iPhone applications inflict.  Couple that with whatever bugs and leaks abound in firmware 2.0 and my iPhone feels like I&#8217;m operating it through a tub of vaseline most of the time.  The only thing it does quickly anymore is crash.</p>
<p>A couple of longtime Apple developers have more informed commentary on this topic than I do.  <a href="http://www.mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/welcome-to-iphone-your-crappy-mac-of-tomorrow-today.html">Mike Ash</a> has some user-side horror stories, and thinks Apple is setting a gloomy standard with its treatment of iPhone developers and the roadmap one can extrapolate from there.  <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2008/08/03/welcome-to-iphone/">Michael Tsai</a> gets the importance of trust, and enumerates Apple&#8217;s, uh, <em>miscommunications</em> about the iPhone as a platform.</p>
<h2>Competition</h2>
<p>I feel the same dismay about the iPhone as I did about my Mac <a href="http://www.al3x.net/2007/10/if-i-didn-use-mac.html">last October</a>.  At that time, the main thing that kept me from moving away from Apple was hardware alternatives (there still aren&#8217;t any I&#8217;m aware of).  In the mobile space, there aren&#8217;t good alternatives to the iPhone hardware- <em>or</em> software-wise.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.juixe.com/techknow/index.php/2008/06/13/google-io-android/">boned up Android</a>.  It&#8217;s a nice platform.  The primary selling point to developers is through-and-through openness.  You can swap out <em>anything</em> on that bad boy.  There&#8217;s no centralized App Store, but I&#8217;m willing to bet that the App Store will be a market efficiency bottleneck, long-term.  Point is, Android is neat (in a vacuum, under glass).  <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.co.uk/news/news.phtml/16610/17634/htc-confirms-android-handsets-schedule.phtml">Might even ship this year</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/14/AR2008071401406.html">Android doesn&#8217;t seem to be going so well</a>.  Third-party developers are pissed that Google is cherry-picking who gets platform updates, which makes the openness story more of a fairy tale.  Rumor around the Bay Area tech community is that key Android team members have split over Google&#8217;s mishandling of the project.</p>
<p>Best I can tell, Android is the stand-out contender for the iPhone&#8217;s future-of-mobile title.  Is there an emoticon that expresses nervous tugging at one&#8217;s collar?</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Like Ash says, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to keep using this thing. Despite all the flaws, it&#8217;s still a useful device to have[.]&#8221;  There isn&#8217;t an alternative, and I don&#8217;t particularly want to go back to a phone that would provide less functionality and require me to carry other devices (music player, navigation system).</p>
<p>The more I work with technology, the more love/hate my relationship with technology becomes.  I&#8217;m to the point that I don&#8217;t want to look at a computer come the weekend.  If my mobile works the way it should, I shouldn&#8217;t need to.  I should be able to trust the device I carry with me all the time.  But I don&#8217;t trust iPhone 2.0.  It takes me farther away from how I want technology to fit into my life.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why I complain about it so goddamn much.</p>
