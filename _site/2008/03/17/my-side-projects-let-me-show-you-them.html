<h1>My Side-Projects: Let Me Show You Them</h1>
<p>I wrote about the value of <a href="http://www.al3x.net/2008/02/on-side-projects.html">side-projects</a> back in February, in part because I had a total lack of them at the time.  Shortly thereafter, that changed.  Rather than picking up the side-projects I mentioned in that post, I&#8217;ve ended up spending a few spare hours on other things entirely</p>
<h2>git-wiki!</h2>
<p><a href="http://github.com/al3x/git-wiki/tree/master">git-wiki</a> is a web-based wiki whose data store is a Git repository of plain text files.  I found the original implementation by <a href="http://atonie.org/2008/02/git-wiki">Simon Rozet</a> while browsing recent commits on <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> and got inspired.</p>
<p>I kicked some patches around with <a href="http://overstimulate.com/">Jesse Andrews</a>, and pretty soon our version was a good ways beyond where Simon started.  I&#8217;ve gotten permission from Simon to fork the project under a new (ideally, sexier) name, but nothing has come to me just yet.  Others are creating their own forks of git-wiki and contributing improvements,  expect it to be a pretty solid wiki for personal use or small teams fairly soon.  If nothing else, it&#8217;s got a simple, clean design.</p>
<h2>Down for everyone or just me?</h2>
<p>The other day a friend Twittered &#8220;is LiveJournal down for everyone, or just me?&#8221;  It was about the billionth time I&#8217;ve seen someone on a forum, <span class="caps">IRC</span>, IM, or Twitter ask if a site was down.  See, sometimes bad things happen to good internet connections, and there&#8217;s no telling if someone upstream from you biffed the <span class="caps">DNS</span> server or if your destination is actually unreachable.  <a href="http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/">downforeveryoneorjustme.com</a> is one trivial answer to this perennial question.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: you type in a domain, we transform what you typed in to something sane, and then we do a <span class="caps">HEAD</span> request against &#8220;/&#8221; for that domain.  If the site responds in 4 seconds, it&#8217;s up.  If it doesn&#8217;t, we report that it &#8220;looks down from here&#8221;.  This is, of course, totally cheesy.  But it also tells you what you need to know 90% of the time.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not a pro-grade monitoring solution.  This is for quick, simple checks against popular domains.  It gives you a quick answer and lets you go on your way, only encumbering you with some tasteful AdWords (not that I see them with my ad-blocker on).  If it&#8217;s not the level of detail you&#8217;re looking for, there are a ton of tools that do geographically multi-homed monitoring, historical reports, etc.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done nothing to promote the site other than Twitter about it and put it on <a href="http://del.icio.us/al3x">my del.icio.us</a> since bringing it online this past Thursday evening.  In that time it&#8217;s had over 85,000 visits and over 232,000 pageviews according to Google Analytics, which is pretty much insane.  It&#8217;s running off of a tiny <a href="http://gandi.net/">Gandi</a> <span class="caps">VPS</span> and the code is a couple hundred lines (including templates) of  Ruby, powered by the <a href="http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/">Sinatra</a> micro web framework.  I&#8217;m running four instances of the application behind <a href="http://nginx.net/">Nginx</a>, and save for the occasional slow request it&#8217;s been standing up pretty well (low load on the box, response times are usually fast).  I&#8217;ll probably switch from serving via Mongrel to <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a> fairly soon, once traffic has calmed down a bit.</p>
<h2>Where Is Britt?</h2>
<p>The future of geolocation is <a href="http://whereisbritt.com/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>What I&#8217;ve Learned</h2>
<p>While <a href="http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/">downforeveryoneorjustme.com</a> has quickly become popular, it&#8217;s more responsibility than I really wanted out of a quick hack.  If it gives someone a wrong answer, that sucks, but I don&#8217;t have the time or resources or desire to build the ideal solution.  I hope that some big <span class="caps">ISP</span> or networking outfit takes the simple design and puts it in front of a proper setup.  In the meantime, it&#8217;s novel to be making a few bucks off of AdWords, which I&#8217;ve never tried before.</p>
<p>Working on git-wiki is, like most developer-oriented projects I&#8217;ve spent time on, much more rewarding.  Other developers are the best customers.  But I&#8217;m actually spending more time hacking on it than, say, putting stuff in my personal wiki.   I have the feeling that the quote-management application I&#8217;ve been dreaming of would be the same sort of affair: put hours into building it, use it for mere minutes.</p>
<p>Honestly, what I&#8217;ve learned is that I need a hobby that isn&#8217;t coding.  I haven&#8217;t understood why so many programmers get involved with gaming when coding is, for me, really enjoyable.  But it&#8217;s hard to code something worthwhile and exciting that doesn&#8217;t leave you beholden to supporting that code and its users.  Really good personal projects quickly become jobs.  Sometimes that&#8217;s what you want, but one job is enough for me at this point in time.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I&#8217;ve ended up with a quandary: how do you keep side-projects manageable?</p>
