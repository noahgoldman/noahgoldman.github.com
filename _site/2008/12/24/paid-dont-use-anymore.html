<h1>Software I Paid For But No Longer Use</h1>
<p>As much as I like open source, I enjoy paying for software. Give me a good solution with a nice interface, and I&#8217;ll give you some reasonable amount of money.</p>
<p>Digital life being fluid and transient, even paid software can quickly fall to the bottom of the virtual junk drawer. Sometimes I feel that an application was worth paying for if only for temporary use, and sometimes not.</p>
<p>Towards the end of discovering which purchases I valued and which I regret, two lists.</p>
<h2>Desktop Apps</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://acquisitionx.com/">Acquisition</a> &#8212; file sharing has long since moved on from Gnutella. I&#8217;ve heard it said that there&#8217;s no sense in paying for file sharing software, and I think I&#8217;ve come around to that. Moderate regret.</li>
	<li><a href="http://mirasoftware.com/BPE2/">BluePhoneElite</a> &#8212; worth every penny, even though its days are over. The iPhone can&#8217;t do all the tricks that my <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/sony-ericsson-t616-at/4505-6454_7-20912537.html">Sony Ericsson T616</a> could do when hooked up to BluePhoneElite. No regret.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.nullriver.com/products/connect360">Connect360</a> &#8212; worked great while I had an Xbox, but I&#8217;ve long since sold it. Moderate regret.</li>
	<li><a href="http://growlichat.com/download.php">GrowliChat</a> &#8212; deprecated by <a href="http://www.ksuther.com/chax/">Chax</a>, which I also no longer use but never paid for. I&#8217;m not sure why I ever wanted Growl notifications for IM presence, as it&#8217;s distracting and useless. Little regret, though, as it was all of $5.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> &#8212; slight regret. I have enough of a personal organizational system set up that this automated filing utility didn&#8217;t really provide much benefit for me.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> &#8212; I always just wanted to write blog posts in my text editor, and now I can. No regret, though, as I got MarsEdit for free when I bought a license for&#8230;</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/">NetNewsWire</a> &#8212; no regrets here. I&#8217;ve long since switched to <a href="http://google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> by way of <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">NewsFire</a> (see below), but at the beginning of my blog-reading days, <span class="caps">NNW</span> was essential and a pleasure to use.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">NewsFire</a> &#8212; paid for it, loved its simplicity compared to <span class="caps">NNW</span>, but then it was made free. Moderate regret.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.bitcartel.com/pandorajam/">PandoraJam</a> &#8212; this was useful when Twitter had a shared AirPort speaker in the office, as it took most of the personal taste out of what got played. (&#8220;Don&#8217;t blame me, I put it on the Joy Division station.&#8221;) Now that I use <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> whenever I want streaming music, I don&#8217;t really need this app. Moderate regret.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.techspansion.com/">Visual Hub</a> &#8212; used it a few times, but then the app got discontinued and open-sourced. I recall buying this right before a trip, desperate to find an easy way to convert some movies to an iPhone-friendly format. It wasn&#8217;t worth it, and I regret not using open source tools for this specialized task. Deep regret.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.xtorrentp2p.com/">Xtorrent Pro</a> &#8212; integrated search and feed subscriptions are killer features for a BitTorrent client. My need for Xtorrent was obviated by <a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a>, though, which carries all the shows that used to, uh, magically appear on my hard drive. Slight regret, but probably worthwhile.</li>
</ul>
<h2>iPhone Apps</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.pangeasoft.net/iphone/enigmo/info.html">Enigmo</a> &#8212; deep regret. I bought it when it was $9.99 without remembering that I don&#8217;t actually enjoy playing games. Beat a few levels, deleted it.</li>
	<li><a href="http://sketchesapp.com/">Sketches</a> &#8212; I can&#8217;t draw on paper, much less on a touch screen, and I&#8217;ve never had the desire to do so since the day I bought Sketches. Moderate regret. I keep it on my iPhone in case the need/desire to sketch arises anew.</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_Origins">Spore Origins</a> &#8212; same story as Enigmo. I was eagerly awaiting Spore, because I thought it was the sort of game I might enjoy, and bought this tedious thing instead. Deep regret.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mustacheinc.com/summizer">Summizer</a> &#8212; a great app, but most of its functionality can now be found in <a href="http://www.atebits.com/software/tweetie/">Tweetie</a>. Moderate regret, but I&#8217;d have none if it had been cheaper.</li>
	<li><a href="http://iconfactory.com/home/permalink/2009">Twitterrific</a> &#8212; pretty the same deal as Summizer. Twitterrific has a much stronger design sensibility than Tweetie, but Tweetie does more and does it faster. No regret, though, as I used it happily for months.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Morals</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Don&#8217;t buy games (if you&#8217;re me).</li>
	<li>Don&#8217;t buy file sharing apps.</li>
	<li>Don&#8217;t buy apps for things you only need to do once in a blue moon. Find a free/open solution.</li>
	<li>Don&#8217;t buy iPhone apps on impulse.</li>
	<li>Expect that software you buy to integrate with a particular piece of hardware probably won&#8217;t have a long life, so budget accordingly.</li>
