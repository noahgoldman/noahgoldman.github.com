<h1>Shared Hosting is a Ghetto</h1>
<p>I haven&#8217;t said much in defense of Rails in the past few months, but a recent <a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/2008/01/07/how-ruby-on-rails-could-be-much-better/">post on Dreamhost&#8217;s blog</a> left me irked.  Now that I see that the post is <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/january#wed-09-rails_dh">still making the rounds</a>, it seems time to respond.</p>
<p>The most popular sound bite from the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The feeling I get from the Rails community is that Rails is being pushed as some sort of high-end application system and that makes it OK to ignore the vast majority of user web environments. You simply cannot ignore the shared hosting users.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh.  Well, the Java community ignored shared hosting users.  The Python community ignored shared hosting users.  Basically every development community save Perl and <span class="caps">PHP</span> have stayed the hell away from shared hosting.  Why?  Because shared hosting is a ghetto (please forgive the <a href="http://tailrank.com/4456975/Rails-Is-A-Ghetto">topical reference</a>).</p>
<p>As a web developer, dealing with shared hosts is a nightmare.  Sure, setting up a server from the ground up has historically been a nightmare too, but I&#8217;ll take that over shared hosting any day.  The constraints, the instability, and the unpredictability of a shared hosting environment are a big part of the reason why the web hosting business is moving towards virtualization everywhere you look.  Big kids need their own sandboxes to play in.</p>
<p>As a programmer who wants to get paid for my work, making an application that I sell to people who then install it on a shared hosting account doesn&#8217;t sound like a great way to make a living.  If you&#8217;ll excuse a callous generalization, it&#8217;s a support nightmare for a down-market customer base.  Plus, nobody but nerds (who don&#8217;t pay for software anyway) install their own web applications anymore.  People use hosted services.</p>
<p>Is it any surprise that even big <span class="caps">PHP</span> and Perl applications like WordPress and Moveable Type now offer hosted services (WordPress.com and TypePad, respectively)?  Hosted services are a better way to make money in the web development business, and Rails is a better fit for such projects.  Case in point: everyone bitches that the various Rails blogging applications don&#8217;t work well on shared hosting accounts, but scores of bloggers are moving over to Rails-based hosted tumblelogging service <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>.  <em>Update: Commenters have clarified that Tumblr is built in <span class="caps">PHP</span>.  Hopefully my point remains intact.</em></p>
<p>My guess is that the Rails community hasn&#8217;t invested time in supporting shared hosts because it&#8217;s simply not worth it.  Extra work for users, extra work for developers, and where&#8217;s the value?  It sounds like Dreamhost is overselling this problem (<a href="http://scott.yang.id.au/2006/01/the-dark-side-of-dreamhost/">much like they oversell capacity</a>).</p>
