<h1>Why I Don&#8217;t Allow Comments, and More on Everything Buckets</h1>
<p>I don&#8217;t allow comments on this site. I have my reasons.</p>
<p>There are certain types of sites for which comments work well. <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/">Metafilter</a> is probably the best example of a long-lived web community that still boasts valuable, cogent comments. Investor Fred Wilson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.avc.com/">A VC</a> blog also consistently has friendly, insightful discussions about finance, music, and more. I&#8217;m willing to admit that comments can be done right.</p>
<p>For most sites, though, comments are worse than useless. The anonymity of the Internet inspires hit-and-run attacks, unintelligible ramblings, and truckloads of spam. I believe that comments are evil by default, and the sites above that seem to have healthy communities are blessed flukes.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all secondary, though. The main reason I don&#8217;t allow comments is that I want to inspire debate. I think people do their best writing when they&#8217;re forced to defend their ideas on their own turf. It&#8217;s one thing to leave a comment on someone else&#8217;s blog, but quite another to put your argument in front of your own readers. It forces a level of consideration that, without fail, results in a higher quality exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t have been happier with the reactions to my <a href="http://al3x.net/2009/01/31/against-everything-buckets.html">Case Against Everything Buckets</a>. For one, it spawned way more discussion than I was ever expecting. But what&#8217;s more, it was a <em>great</em> discussion. I love being told I&#8217;m wrong, and I love it even more when I&#8217;m being told I&#8217;m wrong by smart people who write well. And, for the most part, that&#8217;s exactly what happened.</p>
<h2>The Reactions</h2>
<p>My favorite (mostly) positive reaction was from <a href="http://8stars.org/a/2009/02/09/a-humble-case-against-everything-buckets/">Adam Rice</a>, in no small part for archly and correctly dubbing my piece &#8220;ranty and prescriptivist&#8221;. While a future in which meaning is extracted from unorganized data may be coming, it&#8217;s not here yet, and Adam elaborates on that beautifully.</p>
<p>The developer of ShoveBox, one of the applications I called out, wrote <a href="http://www.wonderwarp.com/blog/archives/107">a thoughtful piece</a> that defends his product as a kind of experimental inbox. He makes some great points about the awkwardness of the desktop metaphor, and in doing so brings up a glaring flaw in my piece: I sort of assumed people realized that I use the Terminal for a lot of this stuff, and spent too much time suggesting that the Finder is the way to go for most file creation/manipulation/organization tasks.</p>
<p>The developer of Tinderbox, a visual information organizer, made a <a href="http://www.markbernstein.org/Feb09/EverythingBuckets.html">compelling argument</a> that Everything Buckets are best used for data that may have future use. My personal filing system overlooks this, for the most part. As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://al3x.net/2007/09/04/anti-task-list.html">written before</a>, I mostly eschew that which I can&#8217;t immediately put into a contextually appropriate tool. Some data &#8211; quotations, for example &#8211;  don&#8217;t fit this model. They need to age, to mature, to eventually find a context and a use. Flat files work reliably for storing this data, but they don&#8217;t add anything to it. Point taken.</p>
<p>Longtime blog buddy Buzz Anderson wrote <a href="http://log.scifihifi.com/post/76989703/everything-buckets">a defense of VoodooPad</a> against my argument. I enjoyed reading it, but I&#8217;m afraid it was unnecessary. I specifically didn&#8217;t call out VoodooPad because I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an Everything Bucket. It&#8217;s a great application for writing hypertext, and hypertext is structured data (at least more structured than plain text). VoodooPad may encourage you to &#8220;put your brain in it&#8221;, but it also suggests sane boundaries about what belongs in it and what doesn&#8217;t. So while I appreciate what Buzz has to say, he&#8217;s preaching to the choir on this one. Michael McCracken <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/2009/02/10/something-buckets/">picked up on this too</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, I won&#8217;t apologize for my &#8220;condescending, engineering-centric view of the world&#8221; when it comes to recommending the use of structured data. Basically, I&#8217;m trying to be the neighborhood greasemonkey, flatly stating that if you learned how your goddamn car actually works, you&#8217;d get better mileage and take it to the shop less often. Sure, I&#8217;d love to live in a future where users can input their data as finger-painting and get meaningful results back, but as Adam Rice recognizes above, we&#8217;re just not there yet. Tut-tut.</p>
<p>Funny, too, that Buzz talks about VoodooPad &#8211; which requires each new page to be named by the user &#8211; as a &#8220;frictionless&#8221; tool when John Gruber takes pains to discuss <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/02/untitled_document_syndrome">Untitled Document Syndrome</a>, in which having to figure out what to call a file is an affront to humanity. I actually liked Gruber&#8217;s response a great deal, and took a sobering look at the applications in my dock after reading it. Except for the tools I use for programming, <em>none</em> of them require me to explicitly create and title documents. The &#8220;library paradigm&#8221; domination Gruber wants to see might already be here today.</p>
<p>All of that speaks to why I don&#8217;t allow comments. Maybe those rebuttals would have been written if I did, but I can&#8217;t be sure. What I do know is that the authors took the time to call me out on their own turf, and I think it made for some great debate.</p>
<h2>Addendum: A Bucket I Can Live With</h2>
<p>I went furniture shopping this past weekend. It was a reconnaissance mission, scouting ahead for potential purchases when I move house in the coming months. En route, I realized with some chagrin that I needed an Everything Bucket. I needed a place in which I could put both text and photos, numbers and labels. I needed a flexible organization scheme. I needed a way to gather a variety of information while mobile and then sort through that information on my Mac when I got home.</p>
<p>While heading over the bridge to Emeryville, I downloaded <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a>. I used it to snap pictures of items and price tags, and to note down in text what couldn&#8217;t be captured photographically. For the most part, it worked great. When I got home, I downloaded the desktop Evernote client and got everything in (gasp) sync. I can&#8217;t see putting <em>everything</em> in Evernote, but it&#8217;s certainly handy to have a mixed-media data capture system when you need one.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to think that my original point still stands: you should pick the best tool for the job, the one that&#8217;s going to do the most for your data. Some jobs require tools that can be misused. It&#8217;d be possible to dump all sorts of things into Evernote that it doesn&#8217;t handle particularly well, like to-do lists. But for a certain type of job, used with discipline, a potential Everything Bucket like Evernote really works. I&#8217;ll be keeping it around.</p>
