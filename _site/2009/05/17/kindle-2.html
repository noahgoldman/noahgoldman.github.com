<h1>Reading The Web on Kindle 2</h1>
<p>When I ordered a Kindle 2 shortly after the device was announced, I promised that I&#8217;d review it. Thanks to <a href="http://programmingscala.com/">the book</a>, I haven&#8217;t had time for much personal writing, but I&#8217;m sneaking this in today between edits.</p>
<p>The Kindle works so well that it&#8217;s difficult to review it in any critical sense. It delivers the experience you&#8217;d imagine it does: you buy books and periodicals, they show up instantly on the device, you read them. Text looks great, it&#8217;s easy to use, and it does indeed have the widely reported effect of making you read more. I had to suffer a couple of lemons before I got one that worked, but Amazon was courteous and quick about replacing them.</p>
<p>Really, the Kindle is a no-brainer purchase. Go buy one; you&#8217;ll be happy with it. That is, if you only want to read books and periodicals on it.</p>
<p><em>Dun-dun-dunnnn</em>.</p>
<p>The Kindle is great for traditional media, but I wanted to see how it fared with hypertext. Shortly after I got my Kindle, I stopped using <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>. I dumped my feeds into <a href="http://kindlefeeder.com/">Kindlefeeder</a>, pruned out the purely visual and aural subscriptions, and set up a delivery schedule such that I had a fresh digest waiting for me when I got home from work. When I found things during the day that I wanted to read in depth, I&#8217;d pop them into <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> and they too would be batched into a digest and delivered once a day.</p>
<p>For a while, this worked well. I was no longer tempted to check the feeds or read interesting articles during the work day, as I had no convenient way of doing so. I got into a routine of reading my daily Kindlefeeder digest just before bed and going through the Instapaper items on the weekends. Looking at text on the Kindle is such a vastly improved experience over reading on a computer or iPhone that I forgave the occasional formatting or delivery error.</p>
<p>If the hypertext you read doesn&#8217;t make use of links, pictures, movies, block quotes, or essentially anything other than paragraphs and markup for emphasis, you&#8217;re set. In my experience, though, the Kindle is a pretty lousy platform for reading hypertext. The browser is filed under &#8220;Experimental&#8221; for a reason: the web looks weird in it, and the browser doesn&#8217;t behave quite like the rest of the Kindle. Bouncing between a Kindlefeeder digest and the browser is slow and clumsy. Technical articles I&#8217;d saved via Instapaper lost critical formatting and diagrams. Frustrating, all around.</p>
<p>This is nobody&#8217;s fault, per se, certainly not Kindlefeeder&#8217;s or Instapaper&#8217;s. Amazon is pretty clear about what you&#8217;re <em>supposed</em> to use the Kindle for, and that&#8217;s books and magazines and maybe the very occasional text-only blog. The Kindle is <em>awesome</em> for these things. It&#8217;s just not a multimedia device.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well hurr&#8221;, you say, but I guess I hadn&#8217;t realized how many of the feeds I read are composed of a rich mix of text, audio, video, and still images. I&#8217;ve been doing the <em>blog thing</em> for long enough that I remember when feeds with images were pretty unorthodox. Tumblelogging has really opened the world of syndicated online publishing up to more than just text. That&#8217;s a good thing for the web, but a bad thing for constrained devices like the Kindle.</p>
<p>So, after a couple months of reading web content pretty much exclusively on the Kindle, I&#8217;ve ultimately decided to go back to Google Reader and a browser on my laptop. Doing so requires more self control, and text doesn&#8217;t look as good, but it opens back up a world of multimedia content that, much to my surprise, I had come to miss.</p>
<p>In a way, I prefer the idea of a barrier between my Kindle and the web. I want my reading time to be about deep engagement with substantive content. Some blogs qualify for that time, but not many. I&#8217;d rather flip through my feed reader over my morning cup of coffee and keep the Kindle for novels, <em>The New Yorker</em>, and perhaps an academic article or two.</p>
