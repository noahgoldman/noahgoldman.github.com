<article class="post">
<h1>My Interview with Waferbaby</h1>
<p>My friend <a href="http://waferbaby.com/">Daniel</a>, perhaps better known as Waferbaby, has started a new section of his ever-evolving web presence that features interviews with people about their hardware and software setups. It&#8217;s called, appropriately, <a href="http://waferbaby.com/setup">The Setup</a>, and I&#8217;m flattered to be the <a href="http://waferbaby.com/setup/2009/01/02/al3x">first person Daniel interviewed</a> for it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve reproduced my answers here for my own record-keeping. In case you&#8217;ve ever wanted to know basically anything about how I compute, I tried to answer Daniel&#8217;s questions in extreme detail. The speculative final question was the most fun to answer.</p>
<h2>So who are you, and what do you do?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m <a href="http://al3x.net/">Alex Payne</a>. I go by <a href="http://twitter.com/al3x">al3x</a> around the Interwho. I work at <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> in San Francisco as their <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/"><span class="caps">API</span></a> Lead. Our <span class="caps">API</span> is how we expose the things you can do with Twitter in a way that programmers can use in their own applications and websites. Part of my workday is spent writing code to make the <span class="caps">API</span> go, and part is spent helping developers out with their questions and suggestions.</p>
<p>In my free time, I&#8217;m working on a book about the <a href="http://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> programming language. I geek out on programming languages, economics, culture, and theory. I <a href="http://seriousdjs.net/">DJ</a> with a friend once a month.</p>
<h2>What hardware are you using to get your work done?</h2>
<p>I have a 15&quot; <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a>, one of the final revisions before the current black-bordered unibody design. It&#8217;s got a 2.6 GHz Core 2 Duo processor and 4 GB of memory. I hook it up to a 30&quot; <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/cinema/">Cinema Display</a> when I&#8217;m at work, and I prop it up on <a href="http://www.raindesigninc.com/ilap.html">Rain Design iLap</a> when I&#8217;m at home. I type <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak</a>, but I leave my keycaps in their factory default <span class="caps">QWERTY</span> layout.</p>
<p>Instrumental to having just one machine is a good networked storage and backup strategy. I have a <a href="http://www.readynas.com/">ReadyNAS NV</a> at home with about 750 GB of expandable <span class="caps">RAID</span> storage. Most of the disk goes to store media that I&#8217;d flip out if I lost, and the rest goes to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html">Time Machine</a> backups. I&#8217;ve also started backing up essential files with <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a>.</p>
<p>I always have my original (pre-3G) 8 GB <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> with me. I listen to <a href="http://store.shure.com/store/shure/en_US/DisplayProductDetailsPage/productID.106610400">Shure SE110MPA</a> headphones on the go and <a href="http://www.audioengineusa.com/a5_home.php">Audioengine 5</a> speakers over an <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">AirPort Express</a> at home. My home network is tied together by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys_WRT54G_series">Linksys WRT54GL</a> wireless router running the <a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato</a> firmware.</p>
<h2>And what software?</h2>
<p>I spend most of my day flipping between <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/technology/unix.html">Terminal</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, and a <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a> app for <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a>. I write Scala and Ruby code in TextMate, run tests and such in Terminal, and answer hell of email with Gmail. I keep Safari mostly ad-free with <a href="http://safariadblock.sourceforge.net/">Safari AdBlock</a> and speed up searching with <a href="http://www.inquisitorx.com/safari/index_en.php">Inquisitor</a>.</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ichat.html">iChat</a> for IM and <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterrific</a> to interact with Twitter. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html#ical">iCal</a> syncs up to <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> for scheduling, and <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> keeps track of my tasks on both my MacBook and my iPhone. I&#8217;ve recently started journaling, and I use <a href="http://www.marinersoftware.com/sitepage.php?page=85">MacJournal</a> for that. I keep a big library of PDFs (academic papers, presentations, books, &amp;c.) in <a href="http://www.yepthat.com/yep/index.html">Yep</a>. I&#8217;ve taken to storing sensitive files in encrypted disk images managed by <a href="http://www.knoxformac.com/">Knox</a>.</p>
<p>I also run some of the usual &#8220;power user&#8221; Mac enhancements: <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a> to make emails go faster, <a href="http://www.obdev.at/launchbar/">LaunchBar</a> to get to what I need quickly and to keep my clipboard history accessible, <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> and <a href="http://growl.info/documentation/hardwaregrowler.php">HardwareGrowler</a> to get visual notifications from software, and <a href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">Caffeine</a> to keep my Mac awake while watching web videos and such. I keep tabs on my machine with <a href="http://islayer.com/apps/istatpro/">iStat pro</a>.</p>
<p>We use <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> at Twitter to share documents, and we make pretty extensive use of <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html">Google Apps</a>. We use <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> for ticketing internally, but I keep <span class="caps">API</span>-related tickets public on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/twitter-api/issues/list">Google Code</a>. We do code reviews with <a href="http://www.review-board.org/">Review Board</a> and browse our <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> repositories with <a href="http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/">cgit</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve usually got <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> or <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> playing, though lately I&#8217;ve been listening to <a href="http://linktoapp.com/bloom">Bloom</a> play itself when I need to focus. Speaking of focus, I use <a href="http://willmore.eu/software/isolator/">Isolator</a> to get distractions out of the way. When I need distractions again, I see what&#8217;s on my <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>.</p>
<h2>What would be your perfect, ultimate setup?</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy">Bill Joy</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN2shXeJNz8&amp;feature=channel_page">said</a> at this year&#8217;s <span class="caps">TED</span> conference, &#8220;I&#8217;d argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers, but we don&#8217;t have very good software for them&#8221;. I&#8217;m of the same mind.</p>
<p>Hardware-wise, my current setup is a dream. I love having just one machine to look after, and I love that it&#8217;s both portable and powerful; my only wish would be for a workday&#8217;s worth of battery life. I can get decent network access nearly anywhere via <a href="http://www.wireless.att.com/businesscenter/broadbandconnect_b2b/?_requestid=42465"><span class="caps">HSDPA</span></a> if Wi-Fi isn&#8217;t available. The Cinema Display lets me sprawl out. My ReadyNAS gives me a sense of security about my data. My iPhone lets me leave the house with just my keys, my wallet, a pair of headphones and this one little magical device that can connect me to anyone, direct me anywhere, and entertain me for days. It&#8217;s a good time for hardware.</p>
<p>Software is another story. I&#8217;m <a href="http://al3x.net/2008/10/22/on-flight-to-old-text-editors.html">perpetually dissatisfied with my text editor</a>, the tool I spend the most time with. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X</a> is the best Mac experience there&#8217;s ever been, but it&#8217;s hardly the best computing experience I can imagine. The iPhone is an incremental improvement, but I can&#8217;t accomplish the majority of my daily computing tasks on it comfortably.</p>
<p>I want to interact with my computer in a fundamentally different way. The desktop metaphor is dead; a generation of children have grown up never working with the physical objects that the virtual desktop represents. What I really want is a modernized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs">Plan 9</a>, a software platform that&#8217;s designed from the ground up for our networked, distributed world. If you try to placate me with the assertion that the Web is this new operating system I will become violent.</p>
<p>I want better software: more usable, more accessible, more open, more secure, more integrated, more seamless. I want a better software development experience. I want better programming languages with better development toolkits. Fundamentally, I want better abstractions for the same computation I can do today with all that lovely hardware.</p>
